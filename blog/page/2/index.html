  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have just released another update to the Rock and Roll with Ember.js book,
keeping it in sync with Ember 1.13.9. On top of that (mostly on top of that,
since there weren&#8217;t as many things to do for the Ember upgrade), I added some
content, removed some other ones, fixed a few wrong paths in code comments,
clarified a few code lines to help people build the app along, and the like. The
usual stuff, quoi.</p>

<p>Here are the bigger chunks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extended the Testing chapter with a (controller) unit test. I removed the
component&#8217;s unit test in an earlier update (integration tests are vastly
superior for components) but now realized unit testing was missing.</li>
<li>Switched to a dashless helper, <code>capitalize</code> instead of <code>capitalize-words</code>.
Ember 1.13.0 and up auto-register helpers with and without dashes, so there is
no need for the more verbose form.</li>
<li>Fixed a few places where the <code>updateRating</code> action was still in the route.
When I switched to a closure action, I had to move the action handler to the
controller but missed a couple of places in the subsequent chapters.</li>
<li>The epub version had two missing code snippets due to bad formatting (thanks
to <a href="https://github.com/morganick">@morganick</a>)</li>
</ul>


<p>There are a few other minor fixes, the whole list can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.13.9+is%3Aclosed">Github issues repo</a></p>

<p>I want to thank <a href="http://andrew.davison-family.com">Andrew Davison</a> who did most
of the error reporting for this update. Thank you, Andrew!</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more goodies early next week, or sign up below so that you don&#8217;t
miss any in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title would probably better be &#8220;Somewhat Complex Component Design in Ember.js&#8221;
but any title including &#8216;Somewhat&#8217; rules out pompousness. I therefore don&#8217;t
claim that the series of blog posts I intend to start here will represent the
pinnacle of component design in Ember. There definitely are and definitely will
be more complex component structures and scenarios.</p>

<p>The component developed in the series is one that autocompletes as the user
starts to write the input and allows selecting from a fixed set of options.
Nothing extraordinary but complex enough so that the design/interaction
principles can be applied and explained while developing the component.</p>

<p>Important disclaimer: I am not an expert on component design (which, it seems
to me, is quite a complex topic). I got intrigued by it thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanflorence">Ryan Florence</a>
and his talks and learned most of the basics from him. My choice of component
probably also has to do something with Ryan. He developed the ic-autocomplete
component from which I took several ideas, sometimes simply copying the
implementation.</p>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>So you probably ask: why reinvent the wheel? Why develop something that is
already done and not something new?</p>

<p>First of all, I (and science says most of us) learn best by doing. I wanted to
use an example where I already have a sample implementation but also understand
why the original implementation did things as it did and see whether I can make
the component simpler or more robust. I wanted to face the problems, to feel
the pain of doing things a certain way, and find solutions for typical,
recurring problems.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also important to remember that when Ryan developed their autocomplete
component, there were no block parameters, no closure actions and no direct
attribute bindings. One still had to resort to observers in several cases.
Two-way bindings were still in, and the de-facto way of communication between
pieces of a component structure.</p>

<p>Ember has come a long way since then and its components converged toward those
of React in its reactive, &#8220;rerender everything&#8221; approach. Potentially some of
the ideas explained in the series can be applied to React and other libraries,
too, and thus might prove useful to more people.</p>

<h3>So many words, so little code</h3>

<p>To have something (almost) tangible in this first intro post, too, let me show
you how one would interact with the finished(?) component. If you have read my
<a href="/2014/06/26/ember-gotcha-controllers-are-singletons.html">earlier</a> <a href="/2014/03/05/sorting-arrays-in-ember-dot-js-by-various-criteria.html">posts</a> or <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">my book</a>, it will come as no surprise that I use it here to
select a great musician from a defined set of them:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/complex-component-design-ember/ember-autocomplete-demo.gif" alt="Selecting an
artist" /></p>

<p>This short intro and the demo have hopefully whetted your appetite and you&#8217;ll
join me for the next part of the series:</p>

</iframe>


<p>When the select view was about to be removed from Ember, a lot of people
-myself included- wondered how it was going to be replaced. My bet was on a
&#8216;select component&#8217;, after all, views should be transformed into components, right?</p>

<p>Then I saw <a href="https://gist.github.com/ef4/8367f996eb7b57d1f7a5">this gist</a> from Edward Faulkner:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action (mut vehicle) value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;
  {{#each vehicles as |vehicleChoice|}}
    &lt;option value={{vehicleChoice}} selected={{eq vehicle vehicleChoice}}&gt;{{vehicleChoice}}&lt;/option&gt;
  {{/each}}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>I did not understand half of it, so I dug down to see how the pieces come
together. In this short post, I want to explain what I have found out.</p>

<h3>Solve a simpler problem</h3>

<p>A great mathematician, George Polya, wrote a book in 1945 called <a href="http://smile.amazon.com/How-Solve-It-Mathematical-Princeton/dp/069111966X/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2147660602?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&amp;ie=UTF8">&#8220;How to Solve It&#8221;</a>,
in which he puts down a framework for solving mathematical problems. One
(probably more) of his recommendations can be applied to software development,
too: Solve a simpler problem.</p>

<p>Heeding this advice, we&#8217;ll first tackle a more mundane problem and in the
second round, we&#8217;ll solve the original riddle.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume Edward had written the following:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action &quot;selectVehicle&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;
  {{#each vehicles as |vehicleChoice|}}
    &lt;option value={{vehicleChoice}} selected={{eq vehicle vehicleChoice}}&gt;{{vehicleChoice}}&lt;/option&gt;
  {{/each}}
&lt;/select&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is easier (as in: more familiar) but there are still a few things that
might need explanation. First, before 1.13.3, event listeners on browser
events could not trigger Ember actions like that:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action &quot;selectVehicle&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>What this does, is that when the selected value of the dropdown changes, it
fires the onchange listener we added on the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> which results in calling
our action handler, <code>selectVehicle</code>. The handler just updates the <code>vehicle</code>
property of the controller. This will mark as selected the dropdown option the
user picked due to the <code>selected={{eq vehicle vehicleChoice}}</code> term.</p>

<p>(<code>eq</code> comes from a great little Ember addon called <a href="https://github.com/jmurphyau/ember-truth-helpers">ember-truth-helpers</a>. It
returns true if the two parameters are equal).</p>

<p>Since there is no two-way binding set up between the selected option of the
dropdown and the controller property (<code>vehicle</code>), this needs to be done using a
DOM event listener (<code>onchange</code>) and updating in the action handler. That&#8217;s
exactly what happens in the <code>selectVehicle</code> action handler.</p>

<p>So far so good, let&#8217;s move on.</p>

<h3>Solve the original one</h3>

<p>Wait a minute. How did <code>selectVehicle</code> receive the selected vehicle choice (e.g
Toyota) when the <code>{{action}}</code> helper did not specify any parameters?</p>

<p>When the browser calls an event listener, it passes it an event object which
would become the first parameter of <code>selectVehicle</code>. However, <code>selectVehicle</code>
does not receive the event but the actual value of the selected option, how does
that come about? The missing link is a lesser-known option of the <code>action</code>
helper, <code>value</code>. The property passed to it is read off of the first parameter of
the handler and then replaces it. In our example, <code>target.value</code> is looked up on
the event object, which is exactly the value of the select option that triggered
the <code>onchange</code> event.</p>

<p>Ok, only one thing left.</p>

<p>The original example had this line:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action (mut vehicle) value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>instead of the more familiar:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;select onchange={{action &quot;selectVehicle&quot; value=&quot;target.value&quot;}}&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>What mut does here is that it allows updating the passed property, so when the
action is called, <code>vehicle</code> is set to the passed value, the value of the
selected option. That is it, we solved the riddle.</p>

<p>The same implementation pattern can be used to update the properties related to
checkboxes, input fields and radio buttons. This new way of doing things takes a
while to get used to, but we&#8217;ll see more and more of it with one-way bindings
becoming best practice.</p>

<p>(By the way, my PR to add a section about <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/670">the actions helper&#8217;s <code>value</code> option</a> to
the guides was merged yesterday, so hopefully more people will know about it.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am happy to announce another update to the Rock and Roll with Ember.js book,
in line with the latest Ember CLI, 1.13.7. Book customers have already received
the updated version, here is how it got better:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Update to Ember CLI 1.13.7</strong></li>
<li><strong>Upgrade to Ember version 1.13.6</strong></li>
<li>Explain better the difference between sync and async test helpers and how
these latter work in Ember</li>
<li>Make the stubs for creating bands and songs not take an id, to be similar to
how the actual API works</li>
<li>Update section about Ember Data being in beta</li>
<li>Show what the custom <code>submit</code> async helper does when it first appears</li>
<li>Remove unit tests for components as <code>ember generate component-test</code> now
generates integration-style tests</li>
<li>Extract the <code>wait</code> helper used across two examples (for showing loading
routes/templates)</li>
<li>Update jsbin in the Templates chapter to use the latest Ember version</li>
<li>Fix importing the capitalizeHelper in the code snippet in the book</li>
<li><p>Last but not least, the pdf version of the book now has page numbers and a
nice, expandable table of contents so you can jump to any chapter or section
from anywhere:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/rarwe-1-13-7/preview-toc.png" alt="Collapsable TOC and page numbers" /></p>

<p>I know, it seems extremely simple to have them from the start but the way the
pdf was generated did not allow for this so we had to find another way. I
again worked with <a href="http://murtra.net/">Almudena Garcia</a> on these design
changes and I whole-heartedly recommend her if you have some front-end (HTML &amp;
CSS) tasks to get done.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There are a couple of other, smaller changes and you can see the whole list in
<a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.13.7+is%3Aclosed">the issues repo</a>. Or you can buy the book <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">here</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s Friday and if it&#8217;s (every 2nd-6th) Friday, it&#8217;s Rock and Roll release day!</p>

<p>Book version 1.13.3 is rolling out as we speak (ok, we don&#8217;t speak and you
probably read this later, but you get the point) which contains the following
changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade to Ember version 1.13.3 (the book is in lockstep, too!)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Update to Ember CLI 1.13.1</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>Extended the Components chapter with closure actions.</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://emberjs.com/blog/2015/06/12/ember-1-13-0-released.html#toc_closure-actions">Closure actions</a> are an awesome new way to fire/handle actions introduced
in 1.13 and so it has to be in the book!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Extended the Testing chapter with component integration tests.</strong></p>

<p>Integration tests make component tests super simple to set up and so much more
descriptive than unit tests. Our beloved star-rating component is now tested
by the shiny new integration tests.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get rid of <code>needs</code> in the controller.</strong></p>

<p>There was one instance where I used this to get a nice placeholder text. As a
preparation for Ember 2.0 where <code>needs</code> is going the way of the dodo, I
removed that nasty <code>needs</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Specify the band-songs relationship as sync.</strong></p>

<p>Starting from 2.0, Ember Data relationships are assumed to be asynchronous
unless otherwise specified. In the Rock &amp; Roll application, we sideload the
songs with the bands, so adding a <code>{ async: false }</code> option to the
relationship was in order.</p></li>
<li><strong>A few CSS fixes, one of them thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/lonekorean">lonekorean</a></strong></li>
</ul>


<p>The whole change list is observable <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues?q=milestone%3A1.13.3+is%3Aclosed">here</a>.</p>

<p>Hoist the sails, Ember 2.0 (and with it, Rock and Roll with Ember 2.0) is on the horizon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today marks the sixth release of my book, <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">Rock and Roll with Ember.js</a>, and
brings it in sync with Ember 1.13. The book follows along the development from
scratch of an Ember application, and chapter by chapter and explains concepts in
the process.</p>

<p>As I have promised, the book is kept up-to-date with the latest stable Ember
version. That implies both using idiomatic Ember and not using deprecated
syntaxes or APIs.</p>

<p>Now that the versioning of Ember Data is in lockstep with that of Ember, I
considered it important to update to the latest Ember Data, too, and will
strive to do so in future releases, too.</p>

<p>Here are the major things I updated for the 1.13 release:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>this.route</code> instead of <code>this.resource</code> in the router map as the latter is now deprecated.</li>
<li>Use <code>Ember.computed</code> and <code>Ember.on</code> instead of the Function prototype
extensions, <code>property</code> and <code>on</code> as extending the Function prototype is
consired a poor practice.</li>
<li>Update the &#8220;Getting ready for Ember 2.0&#8221; chapter as most things are clear now
for the 2.0 release. As I give particular examples for each deprecation, this
chapter can also serve as an update guide for 1.x Ember applications.</li>
<li>Use the new Ember Data find methods, namely <code>store.findAll</code> and
<code>store.findRecord</code>. Before, both fetching a collection and a single record
used <code>store.find</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>As usual, there are also smaller improvements and fixes and you can find the
whole list in the errata/issues repository for the book, assigned to <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues?q=milestone%3A1.13+is%3Aclosed">the release milestone.</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wrote an article called <a href="http://www.toptal.com/emberjs/the-8-most-common-ember-js-developer-mistakes">&#8220;The Top 8 Most Common Ember.js Developer

suggests, it describes the typical pitfalls beginner, and sometimes advanced,
Ember developers make with a mitigation strategy for each of them. I am quite
happy about how it turned out and suggest you <a href="http://www.toptal.com/emberjs/the-8-most-common-ember-js-developer-mistakes">give it a read</a>.</p>

<p>Also, it turned out to have more than 2500 words so I thought it might be
convenient for you to have it as a pdf. It spans 13 pages and you can get it

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started writing my book, Rock &amp; Roll with Ember.js, on July 18, 2014, exactly
7 months ago (More precisely, I prepared some drafts from early chapters most of
which I ended up rewriting before that, but who doesn&#8217;t like a good story?).</p>

<p>Today, I am extremely happy to announce that <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">the book is available for purchase</a>!</p>

<h2>Tame the dreaded Ember.js learning curve</h2>

<p>Ember is said to be hard to learn. Developers who are new to the framework hit
a wall and can&#8217;t easily find out how all the pieces fit together.</p>

<p>My own experience tells me that Ember has a small number of core concepts that
you have to grok to be able to tame the learning curve. Once you understand
these key ideas behind the framework&#8217;s design, you will fly over that wall and
see the green meadow filled with flowers and bunnies.</p>

<p>You will build Ember applications with confidence and - if you are like me -
you will love building them.</p>

<h2>Read it and build it!</h2>

<p>My book also has a concept, and a very pragmatic one at that.</p>

<p>In the book, we are building an application, chapter by chapter. As we
progress, we are adding new features to the application, introducing new
Ember concepts that are needed for implementing the feature.</p>

<p>When a list of bands need to be displayed alongside with the songs of the
selected band, we reach for nested routes.  When we need a widget that displays
stars for the songs, we introduce components. When we want to show the user
that loading data from the backend is in progress, we learn about loading
routes.</p>

<h2>Set List</h2>

<p>The book currently has the following chapters:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction to Ember.js</li>
<li>Ember CLI</li>
<li>Templates and data bindings</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Nested routes</li>
<li>Actions</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Controllers</li>
<li>Advanced routing</li>
<li>Talking to a backend - with Ember Data</li>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Sorting and searching with query params</li>
<li>Loading and error routes</li>
<li>Helpers</li>
<li>Getting ready for Ember 2.0</li>
</ol>


<p>I say &#8216;currently&#8217; because I will definitely have to change some chapters as
Ember evolves (To give an example, Controllers will probably become Routable components).</p>

<h2>A reference book and a reference application</h2>

<p>Ember moves rapidly towards version 2.0. As each minor version is released, it
brings new syntaxes and deprecates old ones. Even though the Ember Core team
takes extreme care to ensure a smooth upgrade process, it is easy for an
application to lag behind, having a few deprecations here and there and not
using the shiny new tools.</p>

<p>The motto of the Ember 2.0 roadmap is &#8220;Stability without Stagnation&#8221;, that old
syntaxes and practices should vanish gradually, giving ample time for developers
to update their applications. At the same time, Ember should not stagnate, it
should introduce new features.</p>

<p>I adhere to this motto, but, more importantly, my book does, too.</p>

<p>I want the book and the Rock &amp; Roll application to be up-to-date with the latest
stable Ember version and not have any of the deprecations. What that means in
practice is that if you buy one of the packages, you will most likely get book
updates after each 1.x release. And at no extra cost to you until 2.0 ships!</p>

<h2>A bonus deal you will definitely like</h2>

<p>When you <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com/#stairway-to-heaven">buy one of the packages</a> you also get access to an awesome deal
from <a href="https://divshot.com">Divshot</a>, a company that provides static hosting for your Ember apps.</p>

<p>You get 3 months free of <a href="https://divshot.com/pricing">their Fleet plan</a>, a $150 value.</p>

<h2>The &#8220;New Beginning&#8221; tour</h2>

<p><del>Wait, there is more!</del> To celebrate that the book has finally seen the
light of day, there is a 25% discount <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com/#pricing">on all packages</a>.</p>

<p>This offer expires on Sunday, February 22, at 23:59 PST, so <a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">grab yours</a> now!</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>I am indebted to all of you who have pushed me through the finish line, either
by praising my screencasts, blog posts and review copies of my book, retweeting
my marketing tweets, giving valuable feedback that made the book better or
simply by pointing out typos in the text.</p>

<p>I would also like to thank you to the Ember Core team whose relentless work
makes Ember better every day. You are putting so much time in, it&#8217;s almost
insane. It&#8217;s kinda obvious but without your contributions, this book would not
exist.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://emberfest.eu">EmberFest 2014</a> ended a week ago and I already feel nostalgic. It
was a great event with great people and you could feel the excitement about
Ember in the air and in all conversations. It was almost single-handedly
organized by <a href="https://haagen-software.no">Joachim Haagen-Skeie</a> for which he deserves huge kudos.</p>

<p>It was really great to associate real people with twitter avatars and have
fascinating conversations about various topics that included the Ember
Inspector, the difficulties in building a build tool and even Firefox OS.</p>

<h3>The functional paradigm making a headway into Emberland</h3>

<p>One thing that struck me about Ember initially is that it seems to rely heavily
on (shared) state. Some (most?) of that is inevitable given Ember being a
performant framework that runs in the browser and is written in Javascript.
None of these facilitates ditching (or minimizing) state and go with a
functional, stateless approach.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I really came to cherish the <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">simplicity</a> of the
functional paradigm and have been gravitating towards languages that allow this
(Clojure was, and still is, <a href="http://balinterdi.com/2013/06/19/the-appeal-of-one-paradigm-languages.html">my favorite</a>). So I added a mental
note about my two favorite things being at such a great distance from each other
and moved on.</p>

<p>One theme of the conference and the hallway talks, however, is how Ember
embraces the functional, immutable approach where it makes sense to. It might
have something to do with my confirmation bias, but let me cite the examples
nevertheless. <a href="https://twitter.com/tchak13">Paul Chavard</a> had a talk on his using immutable data
structures in Ember. <a href="http://www.solitr.com/blog/">Jo Liss</a> revealed how Broccoli uses a
&#8220;rebuild-from-scratch&#8221; approach instead of trying to find out which assets to
rebuild at each modification. Finally, Alex Matchneer, aka. machty, prolific
Ember and router.js contributor had <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1afMLTCpRxhJpurQ97VBHCZkLbR1TEsRnd3yyxuSQ5YY/edit#slide=id.p">a presentation on React vs.  Ember</a>
at EmberNYC which you should go read. His <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1afMLTCpRxhJpurQ97VBHCZkLbR1TEsRnd3yyxuSQ5YY/edit#slide=id.g380053cce_1786">last slide</a> has a bullet-point
that states: &#8220;Don&#8217;t be surprised if Ember adopts DOM-diffing&#8221;.</p>

<p>It would be an understatement if I said I&#8217;m happy to see the functional world
coming to Ember.</p>

<h3>Promises</h3>

<p>I had a talk at the conference called &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me back - How Ember uses
promises and how you can, too&#8221;. As it usually happens, in doing research for the
talk, I learned a lot not just about promises but about other topics, too. This
time, it was the (in)famous run loop I stumbled across on several
occasions so I am really happy I know a lot more about that beast now. You can
find the slides of my presentation below.</p>

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="10"
data-id="47ee01e011b60132c86e02e2e0c65448" data-ratio="1.33333333333333"
src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>


<p>I might even do another talk &#8220;How Ember uses the run loop and how you should
probably not&#8221;, or something to this effect.</p>

<h3>EmberFest 2015</h3>

<p>The greatest thing about EmberFest was its vibe. I saw the tweets coming
in from EmberConf this March and <a href="http://reefpoints.dockyard.com/2014/03/17/emberconf-picks-ups-where-the-rails-community-left-off.html">the post-conf blog posts</a>
about the awesome community and how one could feel the excitement that we are
building apps with a tool that is new and hot now but is probably going to be
the framework of choice for many in a few years. It is definitely a fascinating
world to live in.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll certainly be there at EmberFest 2015, so hopefully see you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is a somewhat subtle bug in the current version of the Rock &amp; Roll with
Ember app. If you start to create a song for an artist that does not have one
and then switch to another one, the song creation process does not need to be
restarted by clicking on the &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you create one?&#8221; link. Also, if you&#8217;ve
already partially inputted the name of the song for the first one, it stays
there for the second artist:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/singleton-controllers/start-song-creation-for-radiohead.png" alt="Start creating a song for Radiohead" />
<img src="/images/posts/singleton-controllers/new-song-for-radiohead.png" alt="Input Karma for Radiohead" />
<img src="/images/posts/singleton-controllers/new-song-for-rhcp.png" alt="Observe song title stays for Red Hot Chili Peppers" /></p>

<p>The above behavior was brought to my attention by <a href="https://twitter.com/davidlormor">David</a>
<a href="http://davidlormor.com">Lormor</a>, an astute reader and watcher of my screencasts.</p>

<p>In some circumstances it is desirable for the result of some user interaction to
linger between route transitions but in other cases it is not. I put the
current example firmly in the latter camp and thus consider the above a bug.</p>

<p>Let me explain what causes this behavior and then provide a simple solution to fix it.</p>

<h3>Repeat after me: controllers are singletons</h3>

<p>Controllers in Ember are singletons. Controllers in Ember are singletons.
Controllers in Ember are singletons.</p>

<p>When the user leaves a page and goes to another one, the controller is not
torn down. It lives on, keeping its properties.</p>

<p>This makes total sense for a framework that aims to be a tool for creating
long-lived, rich-client side applications but is something to watch out for
when you develop Ember applications.</p>

<p>If you have a long background in back-end development, like yours truly,
it is especially easy to fall prey to this, as you could see.</p>

<h3>Same controller, different model</h3>

<p>Initially, when the applicaiton is loaded, the <code>songCreationStarted</code> property
of the controller is set to false. When the user clicks the &#8220;create one&#8221; in the
&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you create one?&#8221; blurb, it is set to true and thus the text input
field appears to allow adding a new song.</p>

<p>Now comes the tricky part. If the user then decides to go to a different artist,
she clicks the name of another artist in the sidebar. What happens? A transition
is made from one <code>ArtistSongsRoute</code> to another <code>ArtistSongsRoute</code>. The artist
is going to be different but the same <code>ArtistSongsController</code> is used.</p>

<p>To prove my point, here are two screenshots of the Ember Inspector&#8217;s sidebar.
The first one is before, the second one is after the transition between
<code>/artists/radiohead/songs</code> and <code>/artists/red-hot-chili-peppers/songs</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/singleton-controllers/ember-inspector-radiohead-songs.png" alt="Ember Inspector - Radiohead songs" />
<img src="/images/posts/singleton-controllers/ember-inspector-rhcp-songs.png" alt="Ember Inspector - RHCP songs" /></p>

<p>You can see that the controller is the same Ember object but the value of the <code>artist</code> property changes.</p>

<h3>Understanding the problem</h3>

<p>When the transition is made between the two artists, the artist object is
changed and consequently any data bound to the artist (and the <code>artist</code> property
of the <code>ArtistSongs</code> controller) is going to be rerendered but, since the
controller instance is not changed, unrelated data will stay unchanged on
screen.</p>

<p>What happens in the code? If you take a look at the template, you see that the
text input field is shown if <code>canCreateSong</code> is true:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;script type=&quot;text/x-handlebars&quot; data-template-name=&quot;artist/songs&quot;&gt;
  {{#if canCreateSong}}
    &lt;div class=&quot;list-group-item&quot;&gt;
      {{input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;new-artist&quot; placeholder=newSongPlaceholder value=newTitle insert-newline=&quot;createSong&quot; }}
      &lt;button class=&quot;btn btn-primary btn-sm new-song-button&quot; {{action &quot;createSong&quot;}}&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;
      (...)
    &lt;/div&gt;
  {{/if}}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p><code>canCreateSong</code> is defined in the controller and is true if either
<code>songCreationStarted</code> is true or if there are already songs. Since
<code>songCreationStarted</code> has just been set to true by the <code>enabledSongCreation</code>
action (and the controller instance is not changed) when the user clicked the
&#8220;create one&#8221; link for the first artist, <code>canCreateSong</code> stays true and the
text field stays visible:</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>A simple fix</h3>

<p>To fix this, the simplest solution is to manually reset the properties that we
do not want to persist.</p>

<p>One solution is to do this in the <code>setupController</code> of the route since that
always gets called when transitioning to a new route:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='js'><span class='line'><span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ArtistSongsRoute</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Ember</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Route</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(...)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">setupController</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">controller</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">model</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">controller</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">model</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">controller</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;artist&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">modelFor</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;artist&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">controller</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;newTitle&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">controller</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;songCreationStarted&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">},</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">(...)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And that totally works. However, I prefer placing this &#8220;resetting&#8221; code in the
controller, probably because it is strictly controller-related and also because
I can make the code really telling there:</p>

<p>The <code>observes</code> function property extension will run the <code>artistDidChange</code> code
every time the <code>artist</code> property of the controller changes and that is exactly
when we need to clear the title and allow the song creation process to be
restarted. Nice, clean and does exactly one thing.</p>

<p><em>Note: The latest version of the code that contains these changes is <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rock-and-roll/releases/tag/fix-start-song-creation-bug">available on Github</a>.</em></p>

<h3>Model Dependent State - UPDATE</h3>

<p>It turns out I stumbled into something substantial. As <a href="http://localhost:4000/2014/06/26/ember-gotcha-controllers-are-singletons.html#comment-1461013970">Luke Melia points out</a> below in the comments (thank you, Luke!),
the above problem has been under consideration for a while.</p>

<p>Alex Matchneer, a member of the Ember core team gave <a href="http://youtu.be/Syv_OTzHOr0">a presentation at EmberConf</a> in which he explains that there is a missing
primitive.</p>

<p>He calls it &#8220;Model Dependent State&#8221; and it is what would decide under what
conditions a certain controller property is &#8220;sticky&#8221; (whether it retains its
value when you change the model of a certain controller or not).</p>

<p><a href="http://youtu.be/Syv_OTzHOr0?t=14m18s">Here</a> is the part where he begins to talk about Model
Dependent State.</p>
