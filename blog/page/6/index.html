<time datetime="2011-09-28T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Sep 28<span>th</span>, 2011</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I graduated from the Technical University of Budapest to earn a M.Sc. in
Software Engineering. Albeit it is supposed to be an asset on my CV I&#8217;ll
argue below that the long years of university education was just not worth it.</p>

<p>When trying to summarize what advantage university education
brought me there is precious little I can think of. Five years is a lot of
time to spend without actually getting something out of it for one&#8217;s
professional career.</p>

<p>Obviously I&#8217;ve formed my opinion based on my university experience which
might not (and probably <em>is</em> not) be applicable to all higher education.
Philosophy, economics and law all require different formation
and practice might be harder (or outright dangerous) to attain in some
areas (think medicine).</p>

<p>Also, there is a great variance between countries although even the famously high-standard
US education system seems to yield not actual but rather
looks-good-on-my-CV benefits, say some <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/10/peter-thiel-were-in-a-bubble-and-its-not-the-internet-its-higher-education/" title="Peter Thiel: Education Bubble">smart</a> <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/18750658" title="Stephen Wolfram">guys</a>.</p>

<h2>Learn to learn?</h2>

<p>Tech is changing extremely rapidly. Today&#8217;s hotness could be a thing of
the past in a few years. Consequently universities should not try to keep up with the
pace and teach students state-of-the-art stuff. Higher education needs to transcend
short-term utility and provide a base one can build on for the rest of
his career. So we were told or made to believe.</p>

<p>What is probably considered the essence of higher education is &#8220;learn to
learn&#8221;. It is the idea that universities need to teach future-engineers
how to quickly adapt to new fields and techniques (programming
languages, databases, architectures, etc.).</p>

<p>This is appealing but universities don&#8217;t do that. I had to sit through
long hours of material not even vaguely related to software engineering.
The practical stuff (e.g programming languages) was taught with stone age style methods
(programming on paper).  The other subjects, those that were supposed to provide us the broad
vision, I suppose, were way too much in volume and failed to achieve that goal.</p>

<h2>Make to learn</h2>

<p>In my current job I&#8217;m lucky to work with some guys who dropped out of
college and started to work. They might not
know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim's_algorithm" title="Prim's algorithm">Prim&#8217;s algorithm</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem" title="Intermediate value theorem">intermediate value theorem</a>,
but I think the result of the time they spent making things greatly surpass the time I
spent learning the above.</p>

<p>Programming (or, in its more CV-friendly, hire-me name: software
engineering) is a task that could be the modern equivalent of wood carving.
You can learn all that you want about the craft, the only thing that
really matters is doing it, a lot. Only, programming is way better.
There is virtually no waste (unless you publish what you make :) ) and
the tools are more accessible and cheaper.</p>

<p>Take it from someone who, unlike most kiddos at the university, started
programming late: it feels awkward and weird at first. And then the
second and third time, too. Slowly, though, you start to feel like it&#8217;s actually
fun and sometimes more than that. You&#8217;re building something which you&#8217;ll
look at ashamedly a few months later but at least your program does something extraordinary,
like sorting a list of numbers. That&#8217;s science!</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree" title="B-tree">Math data constructs</a>, probability theory and cryptography notwithstanding,
have you got this feeling of coolness (dare I say, awe) out of university lectures?</p>

<h2>Total waste, really?</h2>

<p>In fairness, and as a measure to counter my arrogance, I had to consider arguments
on the pro-education side, too. Here is what I came up with:</p>

<h3>Math</h3>

<p>When faced with a programming challenge I
can recall on some occasions an algorithm used to resolve a similar problem.
That&#8217;s not to say you can&#8217;t google up a solution if you have a vague
idea what to look for. Nevertheless if you can mentally page through the solutions
for a given problem from your university classes, their time and space
needs and their constraints then you surely save a lot of time.
I forgot all the relevant facts about any algorithm and have to look it
up every single time, but it could be me.</p>

<h3>Deciding on one&#8217;s vocation</h3>

<p>Most kids don&#8217;t know what to do with their life when they are 18. Real
life still seems distant and most want a few more years of canteen,
beers and idling. Whether it is beneficial for them or society
(taxpayers) as a whole to be allowed to do that is another matter.
Nevertheless, I&#8217;m convinced that a high number of students can have a
clearer picture about whether they want to do &#8220;computer science&#8221; for the
rest of their lives after a couple of years.</p>

<h3>Outstanding teachers</h3>

<p>Even though I reckon you can learn everything you need to know on your
own (from the Internet), having a good teacher can squeeze your
learning curve. Although I believe this is more attainable with a small
group (and even more in a one-to-one, mentoring relationship) it&#8217;s
definitely possible for an outstanding teacher to speed up absorbing
knowledge with a bigger group, too. Unfortunately, with one notable
exception, my teachers were not of this type, but
that&#8217;s a weak argument against college education in general.</p>

<p>Even if all these pro-education arguments are valid, however, a couple
of years is surely enough to derive all the advantages they bring.
Then, you still have 3 years to go and carve wood.</p>

<h2>On navigation</h2>

<p>Let me finally share a quote I&#8217;ve just found in Walden by H.D. Thoreau and that
summarizes my intent with this post in one swell sentence:</p>

<blockquote><p>To my astonishment I was informed on leaving college that I had studied<br/>navigation! &#8211; why, if I had taken one turn down the harbor I should<br/>have known more about it.</p><footer><strong>Henry David Thoreau</strong> <cite>Walden</cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Please defend the status quo (or indulge in bashing it)</h2>

<p>As I stated in the introduction, my opinion is just a drop in the ocean,
a tiny slice in a big cake, a lone voice in the NY Stock Exchange (you
get my point).</p>

<p>If you <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">share your opinion</a>, there will be two voices already and we&#8217;ll
have more information to decide about whether we should advise our children to go
to college, for example. Then three. We may even reach four voices.</p>

<p>Joking aside, if you went to college to learn computer science in Hungary
or in another country, I&#8217;m interested to <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">hear your opinion</a>. If you
studied something else, don&#8217;t be discouraged, please <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2011/09/28/five-wasted-years-futility-of-university-education.html" title="Comments">share also</a>. My
points are mostly valid for computer science but I&#8217;m curious to hear
which other fields they hold true in (or in which fields they don&#8217;t).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> is a blogging engine on top of Jekyll. It got my attention
since it provides themes and a layout that looks great on mobile
devices, too.</p>

<p>I had been playing with the idea to do my own simplistic theming long enough
to realize that I would never do it. The other feature I like is its plugin system:
some I&#8217;ll use right away (e.g Github style codeblock) but I also like
the idea that I can write a plugin for any specific need that might
arise later.</p>

<p>I had had my blog on Jekyll so migration was not really hard. I hit a
few minor roadblocks on the way but <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">documentation</a> is great and the author,
Brandon Mathis was really helpful on the <a href="https://convore.com/octopress/">support forum</a> so
I could eventually sort them out.</p>

<time datetime="2011-07-19T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jul 19<span>th</span>, 2011</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let&#8217;s say you have the following three commits in your local repository:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>% git log -3 --oneline
</span><span class='line'>b648f1a Fix propagating errors in findOrInitialize. (28 seconds ago)
</span><span class='line'>8789cd1 Non-destructive filtering for bumblebees. (12 hours ago)
</span><span class='line'>1a35285 Propagate errors the node.js way. (14 hours ago)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last commit, b648f1a conceptually belongs to the first one, 1a35285.
It only came later because say you haven&#8217;t run the tests before
committing it and only realized later you introduced a bug. Or some
other misdemeanor. Whatever the background is, it would be great if
there was a way to squash the two related commits together. Turns out
there is: interactive rebase.</p>

<p>The syntax of the git-rebase is the following:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>git rebase [-i | --interactive] [options] [--onto &lt;newbase>]
</span><span class='line'>             &lt;upstream> [&lt;branch>]</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>What happens when you do git rebase is that the commits that are on the current
branch but are not in upstream are saved. The current branch is reset to
upstream and then the saved commits are replayed on top of this.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s worth to mention that you should only do this if you have not
pushed out these changesets to a remote where others might have pulled
from it. Rebase creates new commits and if your collaborators pull the
new commits, chaos can ensue. (See &#8220;Perils of Rebase&#8221; in the <a href="http://progit.org/book/ch3-6.html">ProGit
book</a>)</p>

<p>This can be used to achieve what we want:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>% git rebase -i HEAD~3</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Since the commits that are on the current branch but not on the commit
three commits from here are the last three commits, here is what we get:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pick 1a35285 Propagate errors the node.js way.
</span><span class='line'>pick 8789cd1 Non-destructive filtering for bumblebees.
</span><span class='line'>pick b648f1a Fix propagating errors in findOrInitialize.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We want to meld the &#8220;fix&#8221; commit into the &#8220;propagate&#8221; commit since
that&#8217;s how it should have been in the first place. So we move b648f1a up and
squash it into the previous commit:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>pick 1a35285 Propagate errors the node.js way.
</span><span class='line'>squash b648f1a Fix propagating errors in findOrInitialize.
</span><span class='line'>pick 8789cd1 Non-destructive filtering for scales.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After a successful rebase this is how the new log looks like:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>% git log -3 --oneline
</span><span class='line'>73eed18 Non-destructive filtering for bumblebees. (9 seconds ago)
</span><span class='line'>1e63d17 Propagate errors the node.js way. (39 seconds ago)
</span><span class='line'>1b24891 Minor fixes in Bumblebee buzzing. (16 hours ago)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that the three commits we had before have now been nicely compacted
into two, and the propagation commit is now consistent and fixed. It can
now be pushed.</p>

<p>ps. You might wonder what we use bumblebees for in our project. Actually
they are faux. They serve to obfuscate real names in propietary code.
I hope I can one day write code where bumblebees will be first-class
citizens, though.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s been a quiet four months over here. My excuse is that I&#8217;ve been working. I joined a startup, <a href="http://secretsaucepartners.com">Secret Sauce Partners</a> in June and we have started to build our first product a couple of weeks later. Now I am proud (actually, quite proud) to announce that we have released a first version last week.</p>

<h2>The problem we are solving</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you have a Facebook account. You probably have around <a href="http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?statistics">130 &#8220;friends&#8221;</a>. Chances are you want to share lots of things but on several occasions you don&#8217;t want to tell everybody. Sure, you can create friend lists and post to them based on what you want to say. Or, you can pick individual friends for your message (good luck with that if you would like to speak to more than 3 friends). It would definitely make sense (and would hugely improve the state of the world!) if you only showed your Farmville achievements to your friends who play Farmville and nobody else. Especially not your colleagues during work hours.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if you did not have to fiddle with setting the proper audience of your posts every single time you share something? If the people whom you post to would be determined from the content and the context of your message? Better still, if friends that join later could not see your posts prior to that?</p>

<h2>The solution</h2>

<p>Let&#8217;s go back to Farmville-land (I know, I know, but bear with me for a few more minutes). If you only want to show your Farmville posts to selected people the only way to achieve it is to set your default privacy to that list of selected friends prior to diving in to FarmVille. Then you set it back to your default posting setting. Not quite comfortable.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where our application comes into the picture. To solve the above problem, you set up a rule that says:
&#8220;Hide posts from Farmville posted during Work Hours from my Co-Workers&#8221;. You lay back, go feed your piggies, and water your sunflowers safe in the knowledge that your colleagues will not know about it. Suppose you don&#8217;t want your mom to know where you spend your weekends. Here is your rule: &#8220;Hide All posts from Foursquare from Family&#8221;. Feeling the urge to swear like a sailor some times and don&#8217;t want your little cousins or nieces to know about it? &#8220;Always hide posts with Swear Words from Kids&#8221;. Don&#8217;t want to spam your Twitter followers on Facebook? &#8220;Always hide posts from Twitter from Twitter followers&#8221;. Then, there are the &#8220;Show&#8221; rules*. For example, an even more sensible rule for Farmville posts could be: &#8220;Always show posts from Farmville to Players&#8221;.
(* &#8220;Show rules&#8221; are the next feature we are going to work on.)</p>

<p>You see, the possibilities are endless, so why don&#8217;t you <a href="http://donttellmichelle.com/">set up your own rules and give it a try</a>? I bet you will never want to go back to (broken) standard Facebook privacy setting.</p>

<p>Ah, and if you don&#8217;t want your wife to know how much high-cholesterol food you eat, then <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/sweet/2010/03/dont_tell_michelle_obama_says.html">&#8220;Don&#8217;t Tell Michelle&#8221;</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You must have heard the question several times on the Rails mailing list and different IRC channels: &#8220;Should I test validates_uniqueness_of&#8221;? The standard answer to that one is &#8220;No, you definitely should not. It&#8217;s Rails framework code, and it&#8217;s already thoroughly tested. If you followed this path, you should also test whether objects are properly persisted in the database.&#8221;</p>

<p>I think, however, that the question is wrong and thus you can not give a correct answer. It is wrong because validates_uniqueness_of is the implementation, not the requirement. If you approach it from this angle, the question turns into whether you should test the specific implementation or whether you should verify that (business) requirements are met.</p>

<p>That, in turn, comes down to tests vs. specs (short for specifications) and this is again an opportunity for specs to shine. If you write specs instead of tests (or, to put it in a more mind-warping way: if your tests are actually specs), then the above question is a no-brainer: it&#8217;s part of the specification that no two users can have the same email address, so you must have a spec for it:</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you stick with calling your tests tests (how orthodox! ;) ) then not only you have to think (which consumes a lot of resources), but you can also come to the wrong conclusion and emit a strong business requirement from your test suite. And then you might not remember to have the implementation for it after modifying the code for whatever reason. And then bad things might happen.</p>

<p>(This thought came to me when coming to work in the subway this morning. I was never quite comfortable with the name &#8220;specs&#8221; but now it&#8217;s starting to make a lot of sense to me. You are encouraged to disagree. Dissent is what makes the world progress.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you reading this probably use TextMate. It is an excellent editor with two caveats. The first is that you can only see one file in the editing window (no screen split), the other is that there is no save hook. This latter gave me headaches since I can&#8217;t stand any trailing whitespace in source code and the easiest solution would have been to run a script to remove those when the file is saved.</p>

<p>Without further ado I&#8217;ll paste my solution below. Obviously this is not a difficult task to accomplish so the goal is to share not to show off. I use Git for SCM and the following solution parses out the files that have been modified and runs the whitespace eraser script for those. If you use something else (why do you?) you should obviously change the first building block:</p>

<p>If you decide to use this, it is more convenient to <a href="http://gist.github.com/raw/305654/568290aa63ee3b0b3748b5041654f94ce45f4e5b/erase_trailing_whitespace.rb">download the raw source</a></p>

<p>Hopefully I did my tiny bit to have less trailing whitespace in OS code.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve read the <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Progammer - From Journeyman to Master</a> (and if you have not, believe me, you should) you might remember one precious advice: learn a new programming language every year. So when the year draws close to its end (around April, that is) I really start thinking about which language should be the one for me next year.</p>

<p>This reflection is very pleasant; it is such a joy to immerse oneself into a new language, to slowly discover its structure, its subtleties and learn new ways of thinking, of approaching a problem (because that&#8217;s probably the biggest gain of it, even surpassing adding another language to your arsenal) that its prospect is already rewarding in itself.</p>

<p>My choice in 2009 fell on <a href="http://clojure.org">Clojure</a>. I love functional programming, its elegance, its cleanness, its statelessness and after getting my feet wet with <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/acl.html">ANSI Common LISP</a> a while ago I felt like Clojure would propel me on my way of becoming an FP guru. Guided by <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj">a great book</a> I wrote a couple of, admittedly <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/clojure_exercises/blob/master/lzw/compressor.clj">not too difficult</a> <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/clojure_exercises/tree/master/sudoku/game.clj">exercises</a>  (hey, a <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/clojure_exercises/tree/master/sudoku/game.clj">sudoku solver</a> is already something, isn&#8217;t it?) and I would certainly like to continue to do more with it in 2010.</p>

<p>Now, on to 2010.</p>

<p><a href="http://mir.aculo.us">Thomas Fuchs</a> is certainly right when he predicts that <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/2010/01/07/web-developments-next-decade/">Javascript will play an increasingly significant role in web development</a>. I was definitely wrong when I had thought of JS as an undebuggable, structure- and featureless, incoherent language. Of course, you can write Javascript code that is like this but I now think that -at least in the case of Javascript- this tells more about the craftsman than about the language.</p>

<p>Make no mistakes, I can already do Javascript! I can miraculously make a check box appear if you click on a link, or update a database record without reloading the page when you press a button and a ton more such wizardry, really. However, I always felt like there was a whole lot more to Javascript than putting some dumb-looking functions in a file and then include it from my html (no, I don&#8217;t think inlining it makes a difference) and I felt uneasy about my javascript functions just standing there on their own without any apparent belonging to a group or some kind of cohesive force or idea that holds them together.</p>

<p>My recent enthusiasm comes from the fact that I had to browse through some of the source code of <a href="http://script.aculo.us/">scriptaculous</a> and I really liked what I saw. The enthusiasm <a href="http://www.codigoergosum.com/2008/10/09/javascript-method-chain.html">is not totally new</a> but looking at that source code demolished the last shreds of my Javascript skepticism, so to speak. So a year later than <a href="http://www.rubyrailways.com/learn-at-least-one-new-language-every-year/">Peter Szinek</a> I am hopping on the same train: Javascript, here I come! If you have read a good book that enhanced your Javascript foo, please tell me about it in the comments.</p>

<p>And you? Have you already chosen your language for 2010?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As some of you might know, I am running a <a href="http://twitter.com/pragthinklearn">few</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/daily_oblique">twitter</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/wikipedia_tfa">channels</a> that use my brainchild, <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo">twuckoo</a>, to periodically send a tweet.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://twitter.com/pragthinklearn">two</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/daily_oblique">of</a> these cases the program takes its next message from a file and takes care not to tweet the same thing twice by keeping track of the messages already sent. This means, however, that the pool of sendable messages are depleted after a while and the script simply does not send any more tweets, the channel becomes dead.</p>

<p>This has happened a couple of times in the past and I only realized it with a few days of delay which is kind of awkward (if you were subscribed to one of these accounts, I apologize). So I decided to have twuckoo send a notification in this case so I can go in and refill its queue. Hence twuckoo version 0.3.5 was born which sends an email to the address set in the configuration file when it failed to send a message.</p>

<p>To install it, add <a href="http://gemcutter.org">gemcutter</a> to the list of gem sources if you haven&#8217;t already:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>install.sh </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>gem <span class="nb">source</span> --add http://gemcutter.org
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And install twuckoo:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>install.sh </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>gem install twuckoo
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>You might be thinking that it would be more straightforward to have the program replenish itself so that no intervention from the part of the developer is needed. And you would be right, this could be a task for the next version. I still think it is a good idea to send a notification so the (wo)man in charge knows it happened.</p>

<p>So go ahead, have a look at <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo">the README</a>, set up your own twitter channel and don&#8217;t fret about when the queue would run dry. You&#8217;ll be notified.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The title probably tells it all, below is the list of technical books I read in 2009. I am -unfortunately :)- not getting paid for any recommendation that lies herein.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/mjwti/">My Job Went to India</a> <span class="author"><em>by Chad Fowler</em></span></h2>

<p>This one is a real motivation booster. Or it might function like love in the case of separated lovers: if you were motivated in the first place, you&#8217;ll get a kick out of this book and want to do everything it recommends right from the next day. If you were not it might depress you to have to do so many things to stay afloat. Full of useful advices mostly drawn from the author&#8217;s personal experience in India. 5/5!</p>

<p>(There is a second, reworked version under the name: <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer">The Passionate Programmer</a>, you should probably buy that one.)</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/fog0000000249.html">User Interface Design for Programmers</a> <span class="author"><em>by Joel Spolsky</em></span></h2>

<p>I real like Joel Spolsky&#8217;s essays both for the content and for his witty style. I laughed out loud on several remarks in this book, too. The book reaffirms how important good UI is, makes it accessible for programmers by giving guidelines and provides some examples of good (and especially bad) examples. Its style makes the &#8220;dry&#8221; technical stuff fun to read.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources.html">The Pomodoro Technique</a> <span class="author"><em>by Francesco Cirillo</em></span></h2>

<p>A time-management and productivity tool, the Pomodoro Technique is the latest craze. The technique can be summarized in a few paragraphs, the details fill about 40 pages which comprise this book. <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/resources/cirillo/ThePomodoroTechnique_v1-3.pdf">The e-book</a> can be downloaded for free. Although I do not follow all the advices described in the book fully (like administering the tasks you have done at the end of each day) I think the technique is a great way to achieve focus especially if you have problems with it. (The PragProgs have also recently published <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/snfocus/pomodoro-technique-illustrated">a book about it</a>)</p>

<h2><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/shcloj">Programming Clojure</a> <span class="author"><em>by Stuart Halloway</em></span></h2>

<p>Clojure is a functional programming language that runs in the JVM (hence the &#8220;j&#8221;, I guess). This excellent book contains everything you need to know to start (and continue) programming in Clojure from multimethods to infinite sequences, from ways to deal with concurrency to understanding and writing macros. Clojure rocks and so does this book!</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/design1/">The Principles of Beautiful Web Design</a> <span class="author"><em>by Jason Beaird</em></span></h2>

<p>I bought this book to be able to do a fancier design than putting black text on white background and using ugly textboxes with Times Roman fonts. It has certainly lived up to this goal and it has some very practical advices and links to resources (I particularly liked the chapter about color). Just as its title says, it explains principles rather than implementation details, which is what I was looking for. That said, I still feel I need another book (and a decent amount of practice, of course) to beam me to the level I had planned to reach before buying it. Any suggestions?</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9780321146533/Test-Driven-Development">Test-Driven Development By Example</a> <span class="author"><em>by Kent Beck</em></span></h2>

<p>A true classic, I reckon this book is a must-read for anyone aspiring to adhere to TDD or in fact for anyone already doing it at any level of mastery. In the first two chapters two distinct functionalities are developed (the first one, the Money example, in Java, the second, the xUnit example, in Python) by tiny steps using TDD, at each step pondering on the problem at hand and giving an explanation of the chosen solution. The third and final chapter deals with TDD patterns and is an invaluable addition to the first two chapters. Now that I am writing about it I feel like I should reread this book in 2010 (and then probably once every year). Red, green, refactor!</p>

<h2><a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl">Pragmatic Thinking and Learning</a> <span class="author"><em>by Andy Hunt</em></span></h2>

<p>The fact that I have not finished only goes to show its splendidness, I simply don&#8217;t want it to end yet. (I read this in a Paul Graham essay but I can&#8217;t find it right now). Its subtitle, &#8220;Refactor your wetware&#8221;, is telling: it shows you how to make yourself more productive by harnessing the innate capabilities of your brain and debugging its intrinsic &#8220;bugs&#8221;. I guess it is also a very refreshing read because it is about our mind and its workings and not some dry technical stuff. The stories and anecdotes linked to some of the sections makes it easy to recall the message. In fact, I liked this book so much I created a <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo/">&#8220;twitter mini-framework&#8221;</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/pragthinklearn">a twitter channel</a> for the concise version of the advices.</p>

<h2>Life is not just about stubbing, view helpers and achromatic color schemes</h2>

<p>On a Christmas evening, I sat down on a comfy sofa with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Révolutions-J-M-G-Clézio/dp/2070768538">Révolutions by J.M.G. Le Clézio</a> in my hand and was totally immersed in it right from page one. I realized I need occasions like this to repeatedly remind myself how much I miss of life if I only ever read technical books. (Sadly, my list of novels I read last year is a lot shorter than the above one but I heartily recommend you <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128029.A_Thousand_Splendid_Suns">A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/887407.Poisson_D_or">Poisson d&#8217;or by J.M.G. Le Clézio</a>)</p>

<h2>Any good books you have read?</h2>

<p>I am also making a (so far, only mental) list of books for this year and would like to hear your opinion, too. So have you read any books lately that you would passionately recommend for others?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day thinking about how <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/i15r">i15r</a> could be improved I realized that there are times when the language of the non-internationalized site is not English (surprise, surprise). Add to this that lots of languages have &#8220;special&#8221; characters, characters that may not be properly found and replaced by the matchers. So I first learned the basics of <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/understanding_m17n">how Ruby handles encodings</a> (from <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/">James Edward Gray&#8217;s</a> excellent series) and then adjusted a few matchers to catch those special characters, too. (Note: one can&#8217;t underestimate the utility of a spec suite that covers most of the code)</p>

<p>The specs pass but I am pretty certain there are some cases where the matchers might not be up to the task. If you come through such a case, please <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/i15r/issues">submit a bug report</a>. Since there has been a huge improvement in <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/ruby_19s_string">string encoding in Ruby 1.9</a> (basically, strings now have an encoding as opposed to in <a href="http://blog.grayproductions.net/articles/bytes_and_characters_in_ruby_18">Ruby 1.8</a>), there might be some cases where strings are properly internationalized using Ruby 1.9 but not with 1.8.</p>

<p>So if you think this is a valuable addition or just have not tried i15r yet, go get it:</p>
