  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am reading Andy Hunt&#8217;s excellent Pragmatic Thinking and Learning book. There is a section about so called &#8220;oblique strategies&#8221;, short, mysterious phrases that exercise your mind and make you look at problems from another perspective (e.g &#8220;repetition is a form of change&#8221;).</p>

<p>The suggested intake was once a day and there was a free application that did just this for Apple computers. However, the application was so outdated that I could no longer run it on my laptop. So, I set out to write that application and after a bit of thinking decided to make a twitter account where I (&#8220;I&#8221; meaning a script that I wrote :) ) would post an oblique strategy each day and then just follow that account. This way, I can also spread the knowledge around.</p>

<p>Thus <a title="Twuckoo" href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo/tree/master">Twuckoo</a> was born. Twuckoo is a simple program (relying on <a href="http://github.com/cjohansen/twibot/tree/master">twibot</a> for communication with twitter) that lets you periodically post a message on a twitter account. It can fetch the messages from a file, from a database, from the web or whereever you want it to retrieve them from. Its very modular in nature so it delegates the task of getting the next message to twitter and storing the posts to the module. here is currently one generic module, the one that fetches them from a file, and one that fetches them from wikipedia&#8217;s main page. I strongly hope that it is very easy for you to write your own module for your own purpose. Twuckoo aims to follow the &#8220;provide-what&#8217;s-needed-and-then-just-get-out-of-the-way&#8221; principle. Go check out <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo/tree/master">the README</a> for further details.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quite easy to install and run. You can find an example for the file-fetcher module at <a href="http://twitter.com/daily_oblique">http://twitter.com/daily_oblique</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/wikipedia_tfa">http://twitter.com/wikipedia_tfa</a> grabs &#8220;Today&#8217;s Featured Article&#8221; from wikipedia and posts the title and the link so you can grow a little wiser each day :)</p>

<p>Since it is modular it&#8217;s very extensible. I kept the API very simple so writing modules should be a piece of cake. Each module has to define the following methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>load_tweets</strong> Loads the messages that can be twittered.</li>
<li><strong>next</strong> Gets the next message that will be posted.</li>
<li><strong>store</strong> Store the tweet after it had been posted.</li>
</ol>


<p>Once more, I encourage you to scan through <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/twuckoo/">the README</a>, devise your own module and let me know about it. Any feedback is very welcome.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> For my Hungarian-speaking readers, I gave a <a href="http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dccxt9fm_3g8nf5fm5">lightning talk about twuckoo</a> at the latest budapest.rb meetup.</p>

<time datetime="2009-04-27T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Apr 27<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With the proliferation of <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2007/02/introducing-rack.html">middleware applications</a> the mentions of upstream and downstream servers has intensified so I decided to get to the end of this and find out what exactly an upstream server is. I first looked up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_server">wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
In <a title="Computer networking" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_networking">computer networking</a>, <strong>upstream server</strong> refers to a <a title="Server (computing)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)">server</a> that provides service to another server. In other words, upstream server is a server that is located higher in the <a title="Hierarchy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy">hierarchy</a> of servers.
</blockquote>


<p>Ok, so based on this simplistic definition, a sketch of a request&#8217;s route to the application server and the response back can be illustrated like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://bucionrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/request-stack.jpg" border="0" /></p>

<p>In this drawing, the middleware is an upstream server to the underlying application since it provides a service to it (be it caching, url mapping, exception handling and <a href="http://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/tree/master">plenty of others</a>).</p>

<p>So now with my definition established, I was looking for examples in the wild that support it. <a href="http://mwrc2009.confreaks.com/13-mar-2009-11-05-in-a-world-of-middleware-who-needs-monolithic-applications-jon-crosby.html">Jon Crosby&#8217;s excellent presentation</a> at the MountainWest Ruby Conference used upstream in this context as far as I remember. Check one.</p>

<p>Browsing the source code of <a href="http://github.com/rtomayko/rack-cache/tree/master">rack-cache</a> -which, by the way, I strongly encourage you to do if you want to understand caching (better) or just like the look of clean Ruby code- I realized Ryan Tomayko&#8217;s definition of upstream coincides with the above one since he uses downstream in the code to refer to the component/application below the rack-cache component. Check two.</p>

<p>I recently set up an nginx web server as a front end server to a mongrel cluster that runs a Rails application. Ok, so in this case, the nginx server must be the upstream server since requests hit there first and then are passed to the mongrels. One must hear the sound of collapse of cards in my head when I saw the following <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpUpstreamModule">nginx directive</a>:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='bash'>upstream production_mongrels {
  server 127.0.0.1:8000;
  server 127.0.0.1:8001;
  server 127.0.0.1:8002;
}</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Hmm, what? Nginx is above the component it provides a load-balancing service to so by any -ok, by my- definition the directive should say &#8220;downstream&#8221; and not &#8220;upstream&#8221;.</p>

<p>I realize that the request arrow on the diagram moving from top to bottom is a matter of convention and that it probably correlates with the fact that most languages write from the top to the bottom. Nevertheless, as far as I know Nginx is made by a Russian guy and Russians write top to bottom, too, so he should still use &#8220;downstream&#8221; for the directive, now shouldn&#8217;t he? Or did he simply start to sketch up boxes and arrows from bottom to top for the sake of it when designing his web server?</p>

<p>Summing up, I think the above described convention is the common one but since it is not standardized there will always be people and software that uses it the other way around. I am not overly confident though, so please tell me about your definition or just point to examples which support or contradict mine.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A recurring problem in an internationalized Rails project is to see which translations are missing. You could go through all the pages looking for &#8220;translation missing: en, user, new&#8221; texts. That, however is very tedious and error prone. There may be some texts you don&#8217;t even see that are missing translation. (like a title of an image).</p>

<p>A better solution is to write a program that finds these. So that&#8217;s what I did. I gave it a very imaginative name: <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/missing_t/tree/master">missing_t</a>. It&#8217;s darn simple. You first have to install the gem:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
gem install balinterdi-missing_t  
</pre>


<p>and then from the root of your Rails app you type:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
missing_t
</pre>


<p>You will see all the I18n strings that do not have translations along with the file they were found in. If you want to restrict your search for a specific language, you provide its language code as the first parameter, like so:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
missing_t fr
</pre>


<p>For a bit more detailed description, <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/missing_t/tree/master">see the README</a>.</p>

<p>Go ahead, give it a try, your app has the right to speak all those beautiful languages out there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thrifty is a simple application I have written (and am still writing) in Sinatra that tracks your expenses. You can quickly record each spending you make and assign tags to them so you can group your expenditures easily. You can then see how much you spend in different categories (by tags) possibly narrowed down to a given date interval.</p>

<p>Anyway, a web app is all about interaction so give it a try <a href="http://thrifty.heroku.com">on the test site</a> or download it from <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/thrifty">its github repo</a> and run it locally. You&#8217;ll also find a somewhat detailed README there.</p>

<p>This is a very early release so I&#8217;d appreciate any kind of feedback, be it a bug report, a comment on bad UI or anything you might find worthwhile sharing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the start of 2009 my friend Jaime <a href="http://www.jaimeiniesta.com/2009/01/07/mi-resumen-del-2008">resumed his previous year</a> and proposed me to do the same. It seemed a really good idea but somehow it still died down.</p>

<p>I know it&#8217;s March now but I reckon it&#8217;s still ok to do this until December :) I&#8217;ll attempt to write a mini-series of posts about not so much what I did in 2008 but rather what I would like to achieve in 2009.</p>

<p>When I started to work full-time with Ruby I also realized the vast possibilities and magnetism of open source projects. I could -and still can- spend hours browsing among different projects on github, peeping into their code, reading related articles, etc.</p>

<p>So when I set out for this journey one of my tasks naturally became to regularly contribute to a &#8220;serious&#8221; open source project. When I got acquainted with Merb I also got to know <a href="http://datamapper.org/doku.php">DataMapper</a>, its default ORM. I admired its elegance and coherence and the more I knew of it the more I liked it. So when the maintainer position of a dm-more gem, <a href="#dm-constraints">dm-constraints*</a> seemed to be up for grabs I took the opportunity.</p>

<p>That was in December and since then I sent in a few patches and merged changes implemented by others. (which I realized could sometimes be a lot more difficult than writing code :) ). I like to do this and have learned -and probably will learn- a lot so one of my plans for 2009 is to continue with dm-constraints and maybe find other open source projects I could contribute to on a regular basis.</p>

<p>So, if you happen to use DataMapper, which <a href="http://bucionrails.com/2009/02/12/why-i-love-datamapper/">I strongly encourage you to do</a>, and find a bug related to foreign-key constraints, <a href="http://datamapper.lighthouseapp.com/projects/20609-datamapper">file a ticket</a> and assign it directly to me (Balint Erdi). And/or start contributing!</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>




<p id="dm-constraints">* Dm-more is the meta package that contains everything outside the core functions of DataMapper. Dm-constraints deals with foreign key constraints. If you are familiar with ActiveRecord, it is basically the options you specify with :dependent on an association.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I wanted to find the last user in alphabetic order of their names in a Merb project that uses <a href="http://datamapper.org">Datamapper</a> (the default ORM in Merb). So I did [<a href="#love-datamapper-first">*</a>]:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
irb(main):020:0> User.all(:order => [:name]).first.name
 ~ (0.032946) SELECT <column_names> FROM `users` ORDER BY `name` LIMIT 1
=> "Admin User"
</pre>


<p>Ok, so the default sorting order is ascending but I need the last one. There are two ways to do this. Write an SQL snippet and sneak in &#8220;DESC&#8221; somewhere or reverse the collection before taking the first element. Since I was not sure how to sneak in &#8220;DESC&#8221; plus I prefer writing Ruby to writing SQL hands down, I went with the second approach:</p>

<pre lang="bash">
irb(main):021:0> User.all(:order => [:name]).reverse.first.name
 ~ (1.033271) SELECT <column_names> FROM `users` ORDER BY `name` DESC LIMIT 1
=> "XX XX"
</pre>


<p>See what happened? Instead of reverting the collection (which is extra time even if it is done very fast) Datamapper sneaked in that DESC for me! Isn&#8217;t this just brilliant? Datamapper takes the burden to write SQL off of your shoulders. You can keep writing Ruby statements you presumably love and let Datamapper take care of the SQL reaping both the comfort and the performance gain. [<a href="#love-datamapper-second">**</a>]. Also, likewise your app stays database type agnostic. Note how it is not supposed there is a RDBMS under the ORM layer. It could work with CouchDB, for example (I think there is actually work in progress for a CouchDB adapter). This is not the only reason I like Datamapper so much, so if you are still not convinced, go check out <a href="http://datamapper.org/doku.php?id=why_datamapper">some other reasons to use it</a>.</p>

<hr>


<h3>Notes</h3>


<p id="love-datamapper-first">* I could have written this one in a simpler way:
<pre lang="bash">
irb(main):018:0> User.first(:order => [:name]).name
 ~ (0.032345) SELECT <column_names> FROM `users` ORDER BY `name` LIMIT 1
=> "Admin User"
</pre>

But you -or at least I- could not do it for the last element (there is no User.last)

<p id="love-datamapper-second">** I am not suggesting not to learn SQL at all. I am all for a know-thy-tools approach (especially it it means not cluttering your markup with javascript :) ). However, having the ORM do obviously good things for you is worth it most of the time.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am all for <acronym title="Test Driven Development">TDD</acronym>, really. I did not even waver when recently I have been working on a medium-sized Rails project and running the tests after each change took about 60-80 seconds. 60 seconds is still a lot, though, especially if you go through these cycles ~50 times a day (a wild guess). I also believe in very short test-implementation cycles to stay focused so I was starting to think about ways to keep that time down.</p>

<p>Autotest, part of the <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/zentest/">Zentest</a> toolbox is a very good choice. It basically runs all the tests automatically after something has changed in the code and more importantly it only runs the tests it deems affected by the latest change. This helped to reduce the amount of time by reducing the number of tests that were run in each loop.</p>

<p>Another I think less well-known option is <a href="http://www.somethingnimble.com/bliki/deep-test">deep_test</a> which helps to reduce testing time by increasing computational power. More precisely, it runs the tests through worker threads so you can either benefit from using deep_test if you set it up for a computer network (individual computers take from a pool of tests and then send in the results) or if you have a multi-core computer. Since many of us do nowadays, that stepped up as a viable option.</p>

<p>It was quite easy to set up and the results it brought were quite remarkable. It reduced the running time of my tests by ~40% (based on a completely unscientific benchmark). One thing I experienced is that it did not really play out well with sqlite although I have not spent a lot of time trying to make it work there. I just switched to mysql and it worked seamlessly. So yeah, the next logical step was to get the better of both worlds: run only the tests that need to be run and run them on as many cores as possible. I will talk about that in a later post.</p>

<p>I would very much like to hear your experiences and solutions to make TDD a breeze or just plain bearable. I cannot imagine doing real TDD if running tests takes more than a certain time limit, around maybe 90 seconds. Not only you lose a lot of time waiting for the tests to finish, more importantly you fall out of the falling test-implementation cycle, you lose focus, your mind drifts away and then the whole thing probably just does not work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After Bence Golda&#8217;s presentation at the last <a href="http://www.meetup.com/budapest-rb/">budapest.rb meetup</a> I decided to build something easy in <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> since it seemed so cool and easy to do. And I have to tell you, it really is both.</p>

<p>With zero prior experience with Sinatra and only a bit of fresh <a href="http://haml.hamptoncatlin.com/">HAML</a> knowledge, <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/todo-list/tree/master">my todolist</a> was ready in a few hours. What can you do with it? Add todos to your list and delete them when you are done. What features does it have? Unobtrusive javascript :) What does it lack? Obtrusive javascript :) User-related funcionalities, the possibility of having more lists, seeing done todos, etc. Lots of things. But with the ease of development Sinatra provides I am sure that for a simple application like this these could be added quite quickly. And then <a href="http://tadalist.com/">tadalist.com</a> would be running for its money :) (I know, it&#8217;s free).</p>

<p>ps. I use an ORM, datamapper to not to have to deal with SQL directly, so you&#8217;ll have to &#8220;gem install dm-core&#8221; beyond the sinatra gems if you want to run the app.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was intrigued by the simplicity and elegance of Sinatra as presented by Bence Golda at <a href="http://files.meetup.com/1271139/09-01-22-golda_bence-sinatra.pdf">the last budapest.rb meetup.</a>, so I decided to build a simple application with it (I am planning to talk just a little bit more about that in a later post).</p>

<p>One quick thing I learned the hard way is when generating haml views in Sinatra, you have to use symbols as the name of the view, strings will just be rendered as strings. That was a tough lesson to learn coming from Rails. So while in Rails you can write:</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
  def index
    render :action => :index
  end
</pre>


<p>or</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
  def index
    render :action => "index"
  end
</pre>


<p>In Sinatra, you can only use a symbol to designate the view to be rendered:</p>

<pre lang="ruby">
get '/' do
  haml :index
end
</pre>


<p>Which makes sense, I think, since symbols (unlike strings, see <a href="#strings-symbols">below</a>) with the same name refer to the same entity which is a perfect fit for naming views, now ain&#8217;t they? Plus, I&#8217;ll admit I am in love with them symbols, with their colon in the front and all. And when they are syntax highlighted, I melt.</p>

<div id="strings-symbols">
<pre lang="bash">
irb(main):002:0> sym1 = :index; sym2 = :index; sym1.object_id == sym2.object_id
=> true
irb(main):003:0> s1 = "index"; s2 = "index"; s1.object_id == s2.object_id
=> false
</pre>
</div>
