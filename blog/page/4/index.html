  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ember.js is an outstanding client-side framework for building single-page
applications. To make your application truly come to life, Firebase, being a
real-time backend, is a natural choice as the server-side component.</p>

<p>Sending data between the server and the client is a task all web applications
have to address. However, if one uses the Firebase-Ember.js stack, this
problem is largely abstracted away by these wonderful frameworks.</p>

<p>To make them work together, the Firebase team released their official
Ember.js bindings, <a href="https://github.com/firebase/emberFire">emberFire</a>.</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

<p>Before we look at the making of the actual application it is important to
understand how the emberFire library works.</p>

<p>It is built on two primitives, <code>EmberFire.Object</code> and <code>EmberFire.Array</code>. These
extend <code>Ember.ObjectProxy</code> and <code>Ember.ArrayProxy</code>, respectively. These proxy
objects delegate any <code>get</code> and <code>setProperty</code> calls that are not defined on the
proxy to an underlying content object.</p>

<p>What this means is that we can work with Firebase references in our
application as if they were Ember objects. In the case of a single object,
setting a property will cause a child with that name to be written with the
passed value. When working with an array, the usual array methods (e.g
<code>pushObject</code>) can be used and they will do the right thing in the underlying
Firebase reference (e.g <code>push</code> the new node).</p>

<h3>Setting up the environment</h3>

<p>To set up the necessary dependencies, it is easiest to download the <a href="http://emberjs.com/">latest Ember
starter kit</a> and add the following script tags to the main
template:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;https://cdn.firebase.com/v0/firebase.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&#39;https://cdn.firebase.com/v0/firebase-simple-login.js&#39;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://firebase.github.io/emberFire/emberfire-latest.js&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With that in place, we can start developing. For the sake of focusing on one
single issue at a time, the code snippets in this post do not always exactly
match those in the actual application. If you want to see them in their
entirety, you can always <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/ideavote-emberfire">check the source code on Github</a>.</p>

<h3>The Idealist</h3>

<p>The application we are going to build is an &#8220;Idealist&#8221;. Users can submit ideas
and vote on existing ones.</p>

<p>When one loads the application it looks like the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/balinterdi/ideavote-emberfire/master/public/img/screenshots/ideavote-screenshot-3-640.png" alt="Ideavote screenshot" /></p>

<p>A list of ideas is displayed along with the number of votes for that idea and a
button to vote that idea up.</p>

<p>To get the existing ideas from Firebase, we use the <code>model</code> hook of the
appropriate route:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">dbRoot</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;https://emberfire-ideavote.firebaseio.com&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">ideasPath</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">dbRoot</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/ideas&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">IdeasRoute</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Ember</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Route</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">model</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">EmberFire</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">Array</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">create</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">ref</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Firebase</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">ideasPath</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This loads the ideas in an <code>EmberFire.Array</code> and then iterates through them in the <code>ideas</code> template:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;script type=&quot;text/x-handlebars&quot; data-template-name=&quot;ideas&quot;&gt;
  {{ render &quot;ideas/new&quot; }}
  &lt;div class=&quot;idea-list&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ul class=&quot;unstyled&quot;&gt;
      {{#each controller}}
        {{ render &quot;idea&quot; this }}
      {{/each}}
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>So how does adding a new idea happen? If we take a look at the <code>ideas/new</code>
template, we can see that clicking on the &#8220;Send my idea&#8221; button triggers the
<code>sendIdea</code> action:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;script type=&quot;text/x-handlebars&quot; data-template-name=&quot;ideas/new&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;idea new-idea&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;span9&quot;&gt;
        {{input value=title placeholder=&quot;Your idea here&quot; insert-newline=&quot;sendIdea&quot;}}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;span2&quot;&gt;
        {{#if isDisabled}}
          &lt;button disabled=&quot;disabled&quot; {{bindAttr class=&quot;isDisabled:disabled&quot;}}&gt;Send my idea&lt;/button&gt;
        {{else}}
          &lt;button {{bindAttr class=&quot;isDisabled:disabled&quot;}} {{action sendIdea}}&gt;Send my idea&lt;/button&gt;
        {{/if}}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>The triggered <code>sendIdea</code> action is then handled on the controller:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>We get a reference with a unique id by using Firebase&#8217;s push operation. We
create an <code>EmberFire.Object</code> with that reference and that enables us to do our
magic with the help of Firebase. When we then set any property on the object,
it is going to be persisted on our backend and synchronized to all clients.</p>

<h3>Extending the EmberFire classes</h3>

<p>Up until this point, we did not need to create our own model classes. The basic
EmberFire classes were sufficient for our needs. However, if we need to define
additional behavior for our models, we have to extend these primitives.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, that each user has a certain number of votes and we want
to prevent further voting when she does not have any votes left, as shown on the
next mockup:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/balinterdi/ideavote-emberfire/master/public/img/screenshots/ideavote-screenshot-2-640.png" alt="Ideavote screenshot" /></p>

<p>We can define a computed property on the user that would tell whether she has
any votes left. Computed properties in Ember are properties that depend on
other -computed or &#8220;normal&#8221;- properties and get automatically updated when one of
the dependent properties change.</p>

<p>To do that, we need to define our User model:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">User</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">EmberFire</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">Object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">extend</span><span class="p">({</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">noVotesLeft</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Ember</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">computed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">lte</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;votesLeft&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The above is a computed macro definition that defines <code>noVotesLeft</code> as true if
the <code>votesLeft</code> property of the user is less than or equal to zero.</p>

<p>Then, in the template that renders each idea, we disable the button if that
computed property is true and also give it a grey hue to indicate its disabled
state:</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class='html'>&lt;script type=&quot;text/x-handlebars&quot; data-template-name=&quot;idea&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;idea&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;span8&quot;&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;{{title}}&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;span1&quot;&gt;
          {{voteCount}}
        &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;span2&quot;&gt;
            &lt;button {{bind-attr class=&quot;:btn auth.currentUser.noVotesLeft:btn-disabled:btn-primary&quot;}}
                    {{bind-attr disabled=&quot;auth.currentUser.noVotesLeft&quot;}}&gt;Vote&lt;/button&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Keep in mind that the context of the template is an idea and our computed
property is defined on the user, hence the need for
<code>auth.currentUser.noVotesLeft</code>.</p>

<h3>Wait, there is more</h3>

<p>Taking things a step further, I have also integrated Firebase&#8217;s SimpleLogin
authentication service and prevented the same user to vote on the same idea
multiple times. If you wish to see how these are implemented, I encourage you to
check out <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/ideavote-emberfire">the source code of the project</a>.</p>

<p>I hope I got you interested in learning more about how to build real-time web
applications and gave you a basic example of how to use state-of-the-art tools
to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you followed along my <a href="http://emberjs.balinterdi.com">Build an Ember app screencast series</a> and maybe
played around <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rock-and-roll/releases/tag/episode-7">with the app</a> on your own, you might have
noticed a subtle bug in the application.</p>

<p>When you load the application on the <code>/artists/</code> route and then choose one of
the artists, the artist link gets highlighted correctly:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/roll-your-own-store/active-highlight-works.png" alt="Correct active highlight" /></p>

<p>However, when you reload the app on one of these artists routes (e.g
<code>/artists/pearl-jam</code>), the artist link does not get the active highlight:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/roll-your-own-store/active-highlight-does-not-work.png" alt="Incorrect active highlight" /></p>

<h3>Understanding what is wrong</h3>

<p>The first step of any debugging process is to understand where the bug lies. In
order to do that we have to understand how highlighting a link as active works
in Ember.js.</p>

<p>I wrote about this topic in detail in <a href="http://blog.safaribooksonline.com/2013/10/29/marking-links-as-active-in-ember-js-markdown/">a guest post</a> so let
me just quickly summarize it here.</p>

<p>The artist links are rendered using the <code>link-to</code> helper. When active routes
change (that includes the moment when the app is loaded from scratch) the
<code>isActive</code> property for each link is recomputed. If it is found to be
active, the activeClass is added to the view&#8217;s tag and that enables it to be
displayed differently.</p>

<p>When is a link-to active? When its route name matches one of the current route
names. This is pretty straightforward for static links but what about dynamic ones
with context objects? In those cases, all the context objects have to match in
order for the link to be considered active.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see our particular case. We have the following routes:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Are they identical? Well, intuitively they are but Ember.js does not care about
our intuition and so we should not, either. They are different objects since
both were created by calls to <code>App.Artist.create</code> (<code>App.Artist.createRecord</code>
calls <code>App.Artist.create</code> under the hood) which returns a new object
every time. Bummer.</p>

<h3>Replacing intuition with reality</h3>

<p>Don&#8217;t be sad, it&#8217;s not bad.</p>

<p>What we need is to have the same model object to be returned for the same
identifier. In the matter at hand, given an artist slug (that serves as an
identifier) we want to get back the same <code>App.Artist</code> object every time we use it.</p>

<p>If you think about it, that&#8217;s what identity maps are for.</p>

<h3>Wiring it up with promises</h3>

<p>The identity map needs to be able to retrieve objects and also store them. Most
importantly, it has to return the object from its map if it has already created
it with the passed in id.</p>

<p>I will dump the code below and then explain what it does:</p>

<p>As you can see, I used promises for the retrieval methods of the API.</p>

<p>Promises are a huge improvement over callbacks and deserve their own
<del>article</del> book. They represent eventual values that are going to be
either resolved (meaning success) or rejected (meaning failure) and can be
passed around freely.</p>

<p>Ember.js relies on promises heavily in its <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/asynchronous-routing/#toc_a-word-on-promises">routing API</a> and uses
<a href="https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js">the rsvp promise library</a>. If a promise is returned from any <code>model</code> hook,
the route transition does not begin until <a href="http://emberjs.com/guides/routing/asynchronous-routing/#toc_the-router-pauses-for-promises">the promise is resolved</a>.</p>

<p>Leveraging that property of Ember routing I return promises from both the
<code>findAll</code> and <code>find</code> methods and then use them from the model hooks of
the appropriate routes:</p>

<p>When I call <code>App.IdentityMap.findAll</code> from the <code>ArtistsRoute</code> the rendering of
the <code>artists</code> template is stopped until the promise is resolved. That happens
when the AJAX call has returned with the data for all artists and I call
<code>resolve(artistObjects)</code>.</p>

<p>Next, the model hook for the <code>ArtistsSongsRoute</code> is evaluated. It returns a
promise that has to be resolved in order for the template to be rendered.</p>

<p>The artist is found in the identityMap because it has just been stored there
during the findAll in the previous model hook resolution (see the
<code>identityMap.store('artist', artist.get('slug'), artist);</code> line). Since it is
the same object that was used as the context for the artist link, the bug is
squashed.</p>

<p>The link now gets correctly highlighted as active:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/roll-your-own-store/active-highlight-fixed.png" alt="Active highlight fixed" /></p>

<p>Notice we achieved something else, too. Instead of firing two AJAX calls, one
to fetch all artists and then one to fetch the one serialized in the URL we now
only have one call. We eliminated the second one by returning the object from
the identity map.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I also think our code has become better organized. The models for
our routes have now become one-liners and can quickly be read and understood at
a casual glance instead of being buried under the minutiae of AJAX calls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If your application has lots of things going on or you render a large list, you
might see your once snappy app lose some of that swiftness. Naturally, you want
to speed your application up and the first thing to do in these cases is to know
where the bottlenecks are.</p>

<p>One solution to this is to integrate <a href="https://github.com/eviltrout/ember-renderspeed">ember-renderspeed</a>, a very simple library
released by the Discourse team. It shows the rendering time of your templates
and views on your development console, in a nicely nested form. Don&#8217;t get
frightened by the verb &#8220;integrate&#8221;. It is as easy as <a href="https://raw.github.com/eviltrout/ember-renderspeed/master/ember-renderspeed.js">downloading the js file</a> and
adding a script tag to it.</p>

<p>Once you did that, open your Javascript console in your browser, reload the page
and observe the profile of your application. It is enabled by default on the
Ember discussion forum, so you can take a look there. You will see something
like the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/ember-renderspeed-screenshot.png" alt="ember-renderspeed screenshot" /></p>

<p>Under the hood, ember-renderspeed uses <a href="http://emberjs.com/api/classes/Ember.Instrumentation.html">Ember&#8217;s instrumentation facilities</a>, so
should ember-renderspeed not work for your problem, you can always roll your own
or use a third-party service, like <a href="http://caliper.io/">Caliper</a>.</p>

<p>That said, ember-renderspeed is a very quick and easy way to profile your app
and can be the first tool you reach for when the need arises.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>You want to change a string with another one in some directory in your project.</p>

<p>Here is a one liner to do that:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>for spec_file in $(ag -g _spec.rb spec/); do sed -i.bak 's/john/jane/g' $spec_file; done</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>A few caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>The match should be case-insensitive. Unfortunately, <code>s/john/jane/gI</code> does not
work under OSX.</li>
<li>The -i tells sed to do an in-place replacement. Again, under OSX, however, you
must give an extension for the backup files. A <code>git clean -f</code> can get rid of
these in one fell swoop.</li>
<li>You can use <code>find spec/ -name '_spec.rb'</code> instead of the ag command. <a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/2011/12/27/the-silver-searcher-better-than-ack/">But why
would you?</a></li>
</ul>


<p>(If you know how to do the replacement with awk, or something similar, please
tell me in the comments.)</p>

<p>Your text editor might already have a <code>Find &amp; Replace in project</code> functionality.
But maybe it does not. And surely, the command line version is most flexible.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I was preparing for <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/balint/clojure-data-structures-part-one">my presentation on Clojure data structures</a> I flashed
back to a recent programming task I had to overcome. I don&#8217;t remember exactly
what it was but it involved grouping data by particular keys and having an array
of values for each key. When such a task rears its head I always have to play
around in the REPL (err, the browser console) to see the exact working of each
function I am about to rely on.</p>

<p>Which one changes the array I call it on? Which one returns the new value and
leaves the original intact? What about taking two arrays to make a third one?
Javascript being slightly OOish, may I possibly use the + operator to join them
together?</p>

<p>I spend a considerable amount of time trying these out and since I discover no
overarching design behind how they operate I come away none-the-wiser and so
repeat the same process on a slighly different problem some time later. (slice
vs. splice, anyone?)</p>

<p>Before I bash on javascript some more, I find it important to state that
it&#8217;s an enormous feat <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/A_Short_History_of_JavaScript">to design and implement a language in ten days</a>,
hat tip to Brendan Eich.</p>

<p>The point I want to get across is that not having a solid design principle
behind a language is actually a hindrance. It slows you down by having to try
the pieces (functions, in this case) individually unless you have memorized
them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when you work with a language that has a design philosophy
you gain the benefit of faster development. In Clojure, in the case of
collection types, that principle is immutability. You don&#8217;t have to read the
docs or fiddle around in the REPL. The original never changes, you get the
&#8220;modified&#8221; version in the returned value:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">def </span><span class="nv">y</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">concat </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">])</span><span class="c1">; x [1,2]; y=[1,2,3]</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Let&#8217;s look at another language, Ruby.</p>

<p>Called on an array, <code>push</code>, <code>concat</code>, <code>shift</code>, <code>pop</code> and <code>unshift</code> all modify
their caller. <code>Push</code>, <code>concat</code> and <code>unshift</code> return the modified array, while
<code>shift</code> and <code>pop</code> return the removed element.  So the rule seems to be that
methods that expand the array return the new array, methods that take away an
element return that element. So far so good.</p>

<p>What about <code>take</code> and <code>drop</code>? They both take away a number of elements, from the
beginning or from the end, and the number of elements being passed in as a
parameter. I&#8217;d totally expect these methods to change the original in place.
After all, few names sound more destructive than <code>drop</code>.  We&#8217;re in for a
surprise. Both of them leave the original intact and return the taken (or
dropped elements). In fact, you can pass in a number to both <code>shift</code> and <code>pop</code>
which makes them identical to <code>take</code> and <code>drop</code> with the important distinction
of whether they mutate or not the array they are called on.</p>

<p>To add to the confusion, there is <code>delete</code> which deletes all occurrences of the
element that is given as the parameter and there is <code>compact</code> which does exactly
the same for a special case, nil. (So <code>compact</code> takes no parameter). However,
it turns out that <code>delete</code> is mutating, but <code>compact</code> is not, preferring to return
the array with no nils. <code>compact!</code> comes to the rescue which does mutation and so
<code>x.compact!</code> is the same <code>x.delete(nil)</code>.</p>

<p>To give an analogy from natural languages, learning operations on collections in
Ruby and Javascript is like learning the article for each noun in German (der,
die or das). There are rules but they are hard to remember in the first place
and are often violated.</p>

<p>Learning the same thing in Clojure is like learning articles in English: there
is one true way to do it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ruby-rogues/id436260381">Ruby Rogues</a> is one of the handful of podcasts I usually listen to. This week featured Jeff Atwood who talked about
Discourse, a phenomenal forum platform. Jeff&#8217;s thoughts on several things really struck home so I wanted to jot them down.
You might find these thought-provoking, too. The full transcription is available <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/106-rr-discourse-with-jeff-atwood/#more-1341">here</a></p>

<ul>
<li>Installing a binary app per device is a huge step backward from the web world where you don&#8217;t have to download and upgrade anything. You just go to the website and it works.</li>
<li>Betting on Javascript is a very safe bet. The competition has been the fiercest among browser performances, that is Javascript engines on the client. The engines are guaranteed to improve.</li>
<li>Desktop computers are -in most cases- more performant than the server the application is hosted on. So it makes sense to push computations to the clients, and spread it out among them.</li>
<li>[Discourse] using postgres is a way to force hosting providers move out of the &#8220;server herpes&#8221; (PHP + MySQL). As Discourse becomes more popular, this will give more leverage to remove the herpes from servers.</li>
<li>Why was it [the server side] built in Ruby/Rails? <a href="http://eviltrout.com/">Robin Ward</a> made a game about forums and Jeff contacted him to build Discourse. Robin had used Ruby and thus this decided the Ruby or Python question.</li>
<li>Rule of 3. Kind of a philoshopical belief for Jeff. A component (e.g a datepicker) is proven to be reusable if it was successfully used in three different contexts. Having three major partners for Discourse will really be a tipping point. Etc.</li>
<li>Since Discourse is mainly a rich, client-side app, <a href="http://emberjs.com">Ember</a> plays a much bigger role in its success (or failure) then Ruby. The question is how will Rubyists adapt to Ember, whether they will like it or not.</li>
</ul>


<p>Discourse is built on Ember, and <a href="http://discuss.emberjs.com/">Ember uses Discourse as a forum</a>. For one, I welcome our new rich-client overlords.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I completed the last problem on the <a href="http://4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> site. If you
want to learn Clojure, solving these problems is a great way to do it. Several
of its features -that I&#8217;ll highlight below- make it a great learning tool. Other
features probably arise from <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> being a
(pragmatic) functional programming language. Coming from mostly an OO background
these were also new to me and thus deserve their own paragraph.</p>

<p>I hope that after reading through the list you&#8217;ll end up being persuaded of the
merits and want to solve (some of) the problems yourself. If you do, please let
me know how it went and what you learned from it.</p>

<p>If you really get stuck, there is a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/4clojure">Google group dedicated to the 4Clojure
problems</a>. You can also leave a comment here so I can help or go directly to
check <a href="https://gist.github.com/raw/4008944/9c0577566b9a87e8db03332bf71b6d0b1140748e/4clojure.clj">my solutions</a>. Let&#8217;s jump in.</p>

<h2>Why is 4Clojure a great learning tool?</h2>

<h3>Looking at others&#8217; solutions</h3>

<p>After solving a problem, you can check how the users you follow solved it.
That&#8217;s arguably the most important feature when it comes to learning since it
is essentially a code reading exercise when the functionality of the code is
well-known (since it solves the same problem you&#8217;ve solved) and the authors are
probably more proficient.</p>

<p>On several occasions I saw solutions that were both more concise and clearer
than mine (especially when tackling a hard problem). Dealing with the
inferiority complex on the very short term is dwarved by how much wisdom you
gain from these. For what it&#8217;s worth, the users I learned most from are
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/hypirion">hypirion</a>,
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/jafingerhut">jafingerhut</a> and
<a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/chouser">chouser</a>.</p>

<p>(If you&#8217;d like to follow me, I&#8217;m <a href="http://www.4clojure.com/user/balint">balint</a>
there.)</p>

<h3>Executable, well thought-out test cases</h3>

<p>To submit your solution, you paste your code into a textbox and click a button.
The test cases, which are visible, are then checked one by one. If all the
lamps become green, your solution is accepted. If not, you get an error
message and have to try again.</p>

<p>This method has several advantages. First of all, it eliminates the imprecisions
you might have had after reading the description of the problem. Second, it
gives you a set of examples to work against. Third, they force you to think
deeper about the problem since they are constructed to reject a partial
solution.</p>

<h3>Timeouts</h3>

<p>Your solution can be functional and pass all the test cases but if it does not
finish in a certain time, it will get rejected. I bumped into this on several
occasions. Most of the time it was because I came up with the brute force
solution to a hard problem and hoped I&#8217;d get away with it. In other cases it was
because of a technical issue, like allocating too much memory.</p>

<p>In the first case, it made me think again about the problem (see Hammock-Driven
Development) and come up with a more ingenious solution. In the second case, I
learned something about a technical aspect of the language. In both cases, I
grew a bit wiser about optimization -which is a &#8220;real-world&#8221; coding skill- so
I&#8217;m happy the authors of 4clojure chose to implement this constraint.</p>

<h2>What does one learn about (functional) programming?</h2>

<h3>Hammock-Driven Development</h3>

<p>Also known as “step-away from the computer to solve hard problems”, Hammock-Driven
Development is a term coined by Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure, in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">keynote
speech</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently ridiculing Test Driven Development (TDD), HDD holds that the most
important activity to solve a hard problem is to think deeply about it without
any distractions. Most of the time sitting in front of the computer is a
distraction in itself since it begs to be typed on and prevents actual deep thinking
to happen.</p>

<p>This one is really hard to get used to because whenever we write code we feel like
we&#8217;re getting closer to a solution. Thinking, on the other hand, does not
provide any tangible output.</p>

<p>However, HDD has rung ever more true with me as I progressed. When tackling hard
problems, I tended to think about them for some time and then started to type in
actual code. The problem was, when I felt that the solution became convoluted I
did not go back to the proverbial hammock but carried on with the implementation.
Most of the time it either turned out to be a dead-end or a solution I&#8217;d much
better hide.</p>

<p>Even more importantly, a cleaner solution is one that is easier for
others to understand. Since code is mainly for others to read and occasionally
for computers to execute, more thinking up-front results in less time spent
developing and maintaining the code down the line.</p>

<h3>The REPL is a powerful developer tool</h3>

<p>The power of the REPL is one those realizations most of us coming from OO will
come to. Since FP languages have <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey">very little state</a> and side-effects and
thus a lot of idempotency, trying things at the REPL is taken to the next
level. You launch a REPL once and then copy-paste the building blocks of your
solution between your editor and the REPL (and there are <a href="https://github.com/jpalardy/vim-slime">better</a>
<a href="https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el">solutions</a> then copy-pasting).</p>

<h3>Use higher level functions</h3>

<p>FP languages strive to have a small set of data structures and a high number of
functions that operate on them. Clojure is no exception. Though it&#8217;s not hard to
assemble the higher-level function you need yourself, in the majority of cases,
it&#8217;s just extra work: it&#8217;s probably already defined in the core.</p>

<p>This is something that I learned by reading others&#8217; solutions and learning
about awesome functions (<a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/frequencies">frequencies</a>, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/merge-with">merge-with</a>, <a href="http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/condp">condp</a> come to mind).
After a while I looked up the high-level function myself from <a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet">the
cheatsheet</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Switching between applications is more of a mental context switch than just switching between the panes in the same window. Or at least that&#8217;s what I told myself when I decided I switch from using macvim to the simple command line version. It also brings me pretty close to using tmux which I would primarily use to send commands between panes. Most of the posts about using tmux only briefly touch on switching to command line vim so I thought I&#8217;d fill in the gap somewhat.</p>

fine under Lion, too.</p>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll have to install a fairly recent vim. Homebrew has a policy of not having packages which the operating system already provides, but fortunately there is a <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes">homebrew-dupes</a> repository that has vim:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$ brew install --HEAD https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/vim.rb</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will configure, make and install vim.</p>

<p>Next, I looked for a theme that looks good on both a light and a dark background and has iTerm support (a colorscheme for the terminal emulator). I&#8217;ve found <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Ethan Schoonover&#8217;s solarized theme</a> really cool. Just follow the steps in the <a href="https://github.com/altercation/ethanschoonover.com/tree/master/projects/solarized">README of the repository</a> to download both the vim and the iTerm colorscheme.</p>

<p>To install the iTerm colorscheme, go to Preferences -> Profiles to select your
profile and then click the Colors tab. There is a &#8220;Load Presets&#8221; dropdown from
which you have to choose Import and find the solarized itermcolors file.</p>

<p>To use the vim colorscheme you have to add the colors file to somewhere where
vim finds it. There are many ways to do this, so check out the <a href="https://github.com/altercation/ethanschoonover.com/tree/master/projects/solarized">README</a> to
find the method that suits you.</p>

<p>Once, done you have to set the colorscheme in your vimrc:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>colorscheme solarized</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>(vim finds out the appropriate background automatically, so you don&#8217;t have to
explicitly set the background)</p>

<p>I was all set up and most things worked just like in the GUI version. One thing that bugged me was that my cursor keys stopped working. I don&#8217;t use them for moving and text input but I do for cycling in the command history or flipping between file matches for Command-T. It took me a while to find out that iTerm sends a wrong escape sequence for the arrow keys. I could fix that by selecting another set of key presets for the terminal&#8217;s profile. In iTerm, go to Preferences -> Profiles and select your profile. Select Keys, then Load Preset and select xTerm with Numeric Keypad.</p>

<p>There is one more trick I find handy. If you set</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>set clipboard=unnamed</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>in your config, then anything you copy from vim by the usual vim commands (y, d, x, etc.) will be available on your system clipboard and thus pastable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of us read blog posts every day. We read them, take an idea out of
them and then, most of the time, forget about them. Some of them are stashed
away in the back of our minds, ready to jump out if we face a related
problem.</p>

<p>A precious few of them, however, we keep thinking back to without a specific
reason.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve bitten by the &#8220;mockist&#8221; testing bug when I read <a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2010/3/14/crazy-heretical-and-awesome-the-way-i-write-rails-apps.html">this one</a> a while ago. It expresses a contrarian opinion
about how to test Rails applications which struck me as odd at the time.
That&#8217;s probably the reason I read it several times.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I watched Gregory Moeck&#8217;s <a href="http://confreaks.net/videos/659-rubyconf2011-why-you-don-t-get-mock-objects">Why You Don&#8217;t Get Mock Objects</a> and I was stung by the same bug only more deeply,
this time.</p>

<p>Using that video as a starting point I then roamed Gregory&#8217;s blog for
more and felt like I was beginning to grasp it. Now, obviously, I&#8217;m at the
beginning of this journey and still have a lot of teeth-cutting to do.
Nevertheless, I want to share with you the gems I&#8217;ve found so far.</p>

<p>Gregory&#8217;s blog has a very good primer on the difference between stubs
and mocks: <a href="http://gmoeck.github.com/2011/10/26/stubbing-is-not-enough">&#8220;Stubbing is Not Enough&#8221;</a>. I&#8217;d even go
as far as to claim that it explains its subject better than Martin
Fowler&#8217;s classic <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">&#8220;Stubs Are Not Mocks&#8221;</a>, although that
latter goes into more detail and is a definite must-read, too.</p>

<p>James Golick has another great piece that drives home the point better
than his first post I mentioned: <a href="http://jamesgolick.com/2010/3/10/on-mocks-and-mockist-testing.html">&#8220;On Mocks and Mockist Testing&#8221;</a>.</p>

<p>Along comes Avdi Grimm with his strict sounding <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/07/05/demeter-its-not-just-a-good-idea-its-the-law/">&#8220;Demeter: It’s not just a good idea. It’s the law.&#8221;</a>
, with a very interesting discussion in the comments. The same gentleman
wrote <a href="http://avdi.org/devblog/2011/09/06/making-a-mockery-of-tdd/">&#8220;Making a Mockery of TDD&#8221;</a> in which he
touches on the concept of using mocks as a design tool.</p>

<p>Nick Kallen&#8217;s <a href="http://magicscalingsprinkles.wordpress.com/2010/02/08/why-i-love-everything-you-hate-about-java/">&#8220;Why I love everything you hate about Java&#8221;</a> is clearly provocative
and definitely worth to contemplate on. It is also the only one of the bunch that
does not use Ruby (but Scala) for the code examples.</p>

<p>Finally it seems like the fountainhead in the matter is the <a href="growing">&#8220;Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests&#8221;</a>
book by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce. I&#8217;ve only gotten until putting it
on my reading list so please chime in if you did read it.</p>

<p>Please, also pipe in if there are any materials in the subject you&#8217;d
recommend. It would also be cool to see open source projects that extensively use mocks for testing, the only
one I found so far is <a href="https://github.com/jamesgolick/friendly">friendly</a>.</p>
