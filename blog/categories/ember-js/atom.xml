    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>What is FastBoot and why should you use it?</h2>

<p><a href="https://ember-fastboot.com/">FastBoot</a> is the awesome add-on that adds
server-side rendering to your Ember app. This will make users of your
application see the content of your page before any of the javascript is
downloaded. In other words, the <a href="https://blog.alexmaccaw.com/time-to-first-tweet">"time to first tweet"</a>
of your app is greatly reduced, which is a big win where and when people have slow
or unstable network connections.</p>

<p>Another advantage is that search engine crawlers will have an easier job
indexing your site, which brings SEO benefits.</p>

<p>Furthermore, your site will be readable with Javascript disabled which is
convenient for screen readers.</p>

<p>I recently went through the process of enabling the demo version of the
<a href="http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com">Rock and Roll application</a> to run in Fastboot.
Below, I'm going to tell you about the challenges I encountered and how I
overcame them in the hope that my journey will prove valuable when you do the same for
your app.</p>

<h2>Installing the add-on</h2>

<p>FastBoot is a regular Ember add-on, so installing it is piece of cake:</p>

<pre><code>$ ember install ember-cli-fastboot
</code></pre>

<p>I could then run</p>

<pre><code>$ ember fastboot
</code></pre>

<p>from the project's directory and had the node server serving my application at
port 3000. It's important to note that you should refresh your browser tab each
time you make changes to your code as FastBoot doesn't (yet) auto-refresh the
way <code>ember server</code> does.</p>

<p>I then disabled JavaScript in my browser and then directed my browser to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>

<p>Disabling JavaScript in Chrome is most easily done by expanding the context menu
of Developer Tools and then clicking on Settings:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fastboot/disable-javascript-in-chrome.png" alt="Disable JavaScript" /></p>

<h2>Mirage is disabled in FastBoot mode</h2>

<p>My first obstacle turned out to be Mirage.</p>

<p>Mirage is a great tool for mocking server responses and even <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/blog/2016/07/07/building-an-ember-app-without-a-back-end/">prototyping your Ember app</a>.
I used it in development, too, and it turned out that since <a href="https://github.com/samselikoff/ember-cli-mirage/blob/24f994f4419f1b175c82331b00c3089e3f65c038/index.js#L106">it turns itself off</a>
when your app is running in FastBoot mode, the requests hitherto handled by
Mirage now went out and were thus unhandled.</p>

<p>The fix here was to disable Mirage in development (and, in my case, production,
too) and to make the requests against an actual API.</p>

<p>You also have to add the hosts that will serve your Ember app in FastBoot mode
to a list called hostWhitelist in your app's configuration.</p>

<p>In my case, it contains the host I wanted to deploy it to and any localhost
port:</p>

<p>```js
// config/environment.js
module.exports = function(environment) {
  var ENV = {</p>

<pre><code>(...)
fastboot: {
  hostWhitelist: ['demo.rockandrollwithemberjs.com', /^localhost:\d+$/]
}
</code></pre>

<p>  };
```</p>

<h2>Serving assets</h2>

<p>When I restarted the <code>ember fastboot</code> and looked at the server-rendered version
of my app, I saw that the dynamic data was now correctly rendered on the page.
However, it did not have any styling.</p>

<p>A quick glance at <a href="https://ember-fastboot.com/docs/user-guide">the documentation</a> made me realize I needed to pass the
<code>serve-assets</code> option to the command so that it serves the css (and other asset)
files:</p>

<pre><code>$ ember fastboot --serve-assets
</code></pre>

<h2>document is not defined</h2>

<p>So now the main page, with the list of bands rendered fine but when I selected
one of the bands to have their songs displayed, I got the following error:</p>

<pre><code>Error while processing route: bands.band.songs document is not defined
</code></pre>

<p>Since Fastboot runs your Ember app in a node environment, not in the browser,
<code>document</code> is not present. In my case, I accessed <code>document</code> (through jQuery)
to set the document title, which does not work in FastBoot mode.</p>

<p>The user guide suggested to use <a href="https://github.com/kimroen/ember-cli-document-title">ember-cli-document-title</a>, a FastBoot
compatible way to set document titles. So my next step was to install that
add-on:</p>

<pre><code>$ ember install ember-cli-document-title
</code></pre>

<p>Armed with this great add-on, I only had to define a title (method) in the
corresponding route:</p>

<p>```js
// app/routes/bands/band/songs.js
import Ember from 'ember';</p>

<p>export default Ember.Route.extend({
  (...)
  title() {</p>

<pre><code>let bandName = this.modelFor('bands.band').get('name');
return `${bandName} songs - Rock and Roll`;
</code></pre>

<p>  },
});
```</p>

<h2>Missing dynamic content</h2>

<p>The next thing that did not work was that the songs for a specific band did not
load in FastBoot mode, the list of songs was empty each time.</p>

<p>Adolfo Builes and Jonathan Jackson helped me out by pointing out that songs are
loaded asynchronously. The request to fetch the songs was only fired when the
template rendered each song belonging to the band. FastBoot does not
know when the page is fully rendered and thus relies on the <code>beforeModel</code>,
<code>model</code> and <code>afterModel</code> route hooks having finished their work. When that
happened, the songs were not yet fetched and rendered on the screen yet:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fastboot/songs-missing.png" alt="Songs missing" /></p>

<p>The way to fix this was to block rendering in the <code>afterModel</code> hook, by
returning a promise that fetched the songs:</p>

<p>```js
// app/routes/bands/band/songs.js
import Ember from 'ember';</p>

<p>export default Ember.Route.extend({
  fastboot: Ember.inject.service(),</p>

<p>  afterModel() {</p>

<pre><code>if (this.get('fastboot.isFastBoot')) {
  let band = this.modelFor('bands.band');
  return band.get('songs');
}
</code></pre>

<p>  },
  (...)
});
```</p>

<p>As you can see, I only pre-fetch the songs in FastBoot mode. In the browser, I
let rendering start earlier, with a "pop-in" effect (which can be remedied in
several ways in the browser, too).</p>

<p>The songs now appeared in the FastBoot "view" of the app, too:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/fastboot/songs-present.png" alt="Songs present" /></p>

<p>You can read more about this in the "Use Model Hooks to Defer Rendering" section
of <a href="https://ember-fastboot.com/docs/user-guide">the guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Fastboot-enabled hosting</h2>

<p>It's fine to have FastBoot working in development but nobody actually needs
it to work in that environment. It has to work when deployed to a server.</p>

<p>The guide has <a href="https://ember-fastboot.com/docs/deploying">a whole page on deployment</a>, listing several deployment
options, from which I chose Heroku as it seemed the easiest option. And it really was.</p>

<p>All I had to do was to set the buildpack URL from my project:</p>

<pre><code>$ heroku buildpacks:set https://codon-buildpacks.s3.amazonaws.com/buildpacks/heroku/emberjs.tgz -a rarwe-demo
</code></pre>

<p>I then added a <code>static.json</code> file to the root of my project, to disable forcing
https requests, as the domain is not (yet) SSL-supported:</p>

<p>```js
// static.json
{
  "root": "dist/",
  "https_only": false,
  "clean_urls": true,
  "routes": {</p>

<pre><code>"/**": "index.html"
</code></pre>

<p>  },
  "headers": {</p>

<pre><code>"/**": {
  "Cache-Control": "private, no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, proxy-revalidate",
  "Pragma": "no-cache",
  "Expires": "Sat, 05 Nov 1955 00:00:00 PST",
  "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains;",
  "X-Download-Options": "noopen",
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "X-Frame-Options": "SAMEORIGIN",
  "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block"
},
"/assets/**": { "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=512000" },
"/robots.txt": { "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=512000" },
"/crossdomain.xml": { "Cache-Control": "public, max-age=512000" }
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>This step is really only needed to change the default <code>https_only</code> setting. If
you have SSL set up for your domain, you don't need the <code>static.json</code> file.</p>

<p>The next time I pushed to the remote set up by Heroku, it just worked, and my
app was now FastBoot enabled. Hooray!</p>

    <link href="http://balinterdi.com/2016/10/17/continuous-visual-integration-for-ember-apps.html"/>
    <updated>2016-10-17T19:15:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://balinterdi.com/2016/10/17/continuous-visual-integration-for-ember-apps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I recently watched Mike Fotinakis's presentation at the San Francisco Ember
meetup, <a href="https://youtu.be/iECnXK9EqA4">Continuous Visual Integration with Ember</a>,
and I've become really enthusiastic about visual diffs, and Percy.</p>

<p>It's really worth the time and I highly recommend to watch it. I could say
"watch it now and then come back" but it's a 50-minute long video while this
post takes 5 minutes to read, so I recommend to do it the other way around: read
this post first and then go and watch the presentation where he goes into more
details on what visual diffs and CI are, how Percy works and answers to
questions from the audience.</p>

<p>Ready? Cool. Start the timer and let's go.</p>

<h3>So what is continuous visual integration?</h3>

<p>I will give you the high-level definition and rationale of visual diffs
and continuous visual integration as the post otherwise wouldn't make sense.</p>

<p>When we change code, the intangible stuff apps are made of, we risk breaking it.
To prevent this, we write tests that guard against regression (a nice way of
saying breaking stuff) and do code reviews where someone goes over the code
diffs, and potentially after a series of edits, confirms it.</p>

<p>However, that's just the code part. There are other ways to break a web
application, a major one among them is for the app to look differently than
before, in an unintended way. The background color of a button might change, a
link could have become hidden, or a css file could no longer be downloaded
which all lead to a degraded visual experience for visitors of the app.</p>

<p>Our (textual) tests could pass with flying colors and yet the users of the app
could be running away screaming from our site. Visual diffs guard against that
scenario by showing a visual diff, what certain scenarios looked before and
after the code changes under test.</p>

<h3>Visual diffs as part of the review process</h3>

<p>The idea is to have screenshots made at certain points in our user flows and
have a review process that approves the changes, just as we do for code.</p>

<p>To automate the process, we integrate the generation of visual diffing in the
automated testing process. This will produce the "before" and "after"
screenshots that will be used to generate the diffs. Let's see how this is done
in practice.</p>

<h3>Making all this a breeze with Percy</h3>

<p>Percy is a visual diffing tool that automates all of this and integrates
smoothly into the Github pull request process. To get started with Percy,
install the Ember addon:</p>

<pre><code>$ ember install ember-percy
</code></pre>

<p>If you use Mirage for your tests, like I do, make sure to define a passthrough
rule for Percy on top of your Mirage config, before any other rules (see
<a href="https://percy.io/docs/clients/javascript/ember">the docs</a>):</p>

<p><code>js
// mirage/config.js
export default function() {
  this.passthrough('/_percy/**');
  (...)
})
</code></p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong> Starting from ember-percy version 1.2.4, you no longer need to do the
above as ember-percy doesn't use Mirage anymore.</p>

<p>To demo how the development flow changes to accommodate visual diffing, I prepared <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-demo/pull/10">a PR to make a dropdown</a>
in the <a href="https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-demo">Rock and Roll with Ember demo</a> nicer.</p>

<p>Before implementing the change, I wrote a test that verifies if the songs for a
particular band are listed correctly:</p>

<p>```js
// tests/acceptance/songs-test.js
import Ember from 'ember';
import { test } from 'qunit';</p>

<p>(...)</p>

<p>test('List songs for a band', function(assert) {
  visit('/bands');
  click('a:contains("Tool")');
  percySnapshot('list-songs-for-band');</p>

<p>  andThen(function() {</p>

<pre><code>assert.equal(Ember.$('.song').length, 3, "All songs for the selected band are displayed");
assert.equal(Ember.$('.song:contains("46 &amp; 2")').length, 1, "The first song is displayed");
</code></pre>

<p>  });
});
```</p>

<p>The thing to note here is <code>percySnapshot</code>. If Percy is set up in the environment
where the test runs, it generates a screenshot identified by the name we pass it
(or auto-generates one). To set up Percy, the <code>PERCY_TOKEN</code> and <code>PERCY_PROJECT</code>
env vars need to be set in the CI tool of your choice. <a href="https://percy.io/docs">The Percy
docs</a> explain how.</p>

<p>Once we have a percySnapshot, the next time we push and our CI builds the
project, Percy will have a new snapshot for us:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/visual-ci-with-percy/percy-first-screenshot.png" alt="First screenshot - No diff yet" /></p>

<p>We can now implement our feature on a branch and create a pull request for it on
Github. As you can see on the following screenshot, approving the visual diffs
is now part of the flow:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/visual-ci-with-percy/github-pr-before-percy-approval.png" alt="Github before Percy approval" /></p>

<p>Clicking "Details" takes us to the visual diffs where we must explicilty approve
the changes:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/visual-ci-with-percy/percy-visual-diff.png" alt="Percy visual diffs" /></p>

<p>Once the visual diffs are approved, the PR is all green and we can lean back in
our chairs and merge it, safe in the knowledge we did not visually break the
app.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/visual-ci-with-percy/github-pr-after-percy-approval.png" alt="Github after Percy approval" /></p>

<p>Just as with "normal" tests, the more snapshots we have, the higher the chance
we did not introduce any regressions with our latest changes. Mike recommends a
"breadth first" approach, making screenshots from tests that verify different
scenarios instead of a "depth first" approach, creating several screenshots for
the same scenario.</p>

<h3>Closing words</h3>

<p>I'm all sold on visual diffing and I think there is tremendous value in securing
our apps this way.</p>

<p>I encourage you to <a href="https://youtu.be/iECnXK9EqA4">watch Mike's presentation</a>
and <a href="https://percy.io/">sign up for Percy</a> to become a better steward of your applications.</p>

    <updated>2016-08-11T09:13:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://balinterdi.com/2016/08/11/using-dependency-injection-to-write-better-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Testing is given much emphasis in the Ember.js community, and testing tools have
showed steady progress to reduce the cost of writing tests of all types.</p>

<p>Lauren Tan wrote <a href="https://emberway.io/component-dependency-injection-in-ember-js-a46a39a5d30a#.45qfbv52x">a great post</a>
about how Dependency Injection (DI) can be used to decouple a parent component
from the internals of its child components. One of the gains of doing so is that
the parent component becomes more focused and thus easier to test.</p>

<p>In this post, I'm doing something similar, although much simpler. I want to show
you how to use DI in a simple helper function to make it easier to test.</p>

<h3>Just your ordinary, run-of-the-mill function</h3>

<p>Although the helper is an Ember (template) helper, the concepts could be very
easily transferred to other frameworks, libraries and even languages.</p>

<p>I recently had to modify a <code>normalizeText</code> helper function that looked
like this:</p>

<p>```js
// tests/unit/helpers/normalize-text-test.js
import Ember from 'ember';</p>

<p>export function normalizeText([text]) {
  let normalizedEOLs = text.trim().replace(/(?:\r\n|\r|\n)/g, '</p><p>');
  let noEmptyParagraphs = normalizedEOLs.replace(/(<p>&lt;\/p>)/g, '');
  return Ember.String.htmlSafe("<p>" + noEmptyParagraphs + "</p>");
}
```</p>

<p>(I realize the above code does not handle a text value of <code>undefined</code> or <code>null</code>.
The real code does but I want to keep the code examples to the minimum necessary
to get my point across.)</p>

<h3>Comparing objects to objects</h3>

<p>Its test was quite simple and straightforward:</p>

<p>```js
// tests/unit/helpers/normalize-text-test.js
import { normalizeText } from '../../../helpers/normalize-text';
import { module, test } from 'qunit';</p>

<p>module('Unit | Helper | normalize-text');</p>

<p>test('it works', function(assert) {
  let normalizedText = normalizeText(["The brown fox\r\njumped over the quick rabbit.\n"]);
  assert.equal(normalizedText, "<p>The brown fox</p><p>jumped over the quick rabbit.</p>");
});
```</p>

<p>The problem with that test is that we compare two <code>Handlebars.SafeString</code>
instances (returned by <code>Ember.String.htmlSafe</code>) which are different even if
the strings they wrap, their value, is the same:</p>

<p><code>
let s1 = Ember.String.htmlSafe("sid transit gloria mundi");
let s2 = Ember.String.htmlSafe("sid transit gloria mundi");
s1 === s2 // =&gt; false
</code></p>

<p>We're, however, interested in the equality of the strings. If only there was a
way to replace that pesky <code>Ember.String.htmlSafe</code> call from the call site...</p>

<h3>DI to the rescue</h3>

<p>This is exactly what Dependency Injection can help us do. Instead of hard-coding
that "sanitizer" function dependency, the function could take it as a parameter
so that callers could inject it. Usually DI examples use (and thus inject) class
names or object instances but it is important to realize that the injected param
could be very "primitive", like a simple function.</p>

<p>So here is how I rewrote the function:</p>

<p>```js
// app/helpers/normalize-text.js
import Ember from 'ember';</p>

<p>export function normalizeText([text], params={}) {
  let { sanitizer=Ember.String.htmlSafe } = params;
  let normalizedEOLs = text.trim().replace(/(?:\r\n|\r|\n)/g, '</p><p>');
  let noEmptyParagraphs = normalizedEOLs.replace(/(<p>&lt;\/p>)/g, '');
  return sanitizer("<p>" + noEmptyParagraphs + "</p>");
}</p>

<p>export default Ember.Helper.helper(normalizeText);
```</p>

<p>Notice how easy ES2015 destructuring makes the assignment of the sanitizer
function:</p>

<p><code>js
let { sanitizer=Ember.String.htmlSafe } = params;
</code></p>

<p>If no <code>sanitizer</code> key was present in <code>params</code>, then it will have a value of
<code>Ember.String.htmlSafe</code>, the default behavior.</p>

<p>The call from the test can now override the default behavior of sending the
normalized text through <code>Ember.String.htmlSafe</code> by passing in a "no-op"
sanitizer function:</p>

<p>```js
// tests/unit/helpers/normalize-text-test.js
import { normalizeText } from '../../../helpers/normalize-text';
import { module, test } from 'qunit';</p>

<p>function leaveAsIs(text) {
  return text;
}</p>

<p>module('Unit | Helper | normalize-text');</p>

<p>test('it works', function(assert) {
  let normalizedText = normalizeText(["The brown fox\r\njumped over the quick rabbit.\n"], { sanitizer: leaveAsIs });
  assert.equal(normalizedText, "<p>The brown fox</p><p>jumped over the quick rabbit.</p>");
});
```</p>

<p>We're now comparing simple strings which place nicely with <code>assert.equal</code> (with
<code>===</code>), and our test now passes.</p>

<h3>Non-testing benefits</h3>

<p>Code modifications introduced for the sake of testing usually also improve the
non-testing aspect. Here, we made it possible to pass any function before we
return the normalized text. We could, for example, use this to replace the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
tags with <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>s, if we so wish.</p>
