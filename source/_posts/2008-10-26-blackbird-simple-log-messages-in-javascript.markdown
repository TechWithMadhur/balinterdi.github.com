Using alert() for debugging javascript is a pain. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843" target="_blank">Firebug</a> makes it a lot easier and enables several debug facilities (e.g inserting breakpoints, stepping into methods, adding variable watches) but a painless logging mechanism would still be very useful to supplement Firebug's features.

Enter <a title="Blackbird" href="http://bucionrails.com/http://www.gscottolson.com/blackbirdjs/" target="_blank">Blackbird</a>, a simple javascript logging tool which has a very clean, nice API and a cool console. It's really worth to check out, you can download the Blackbird files <a href="http://blackbirdjs.googlecode.com/files/blackbirdjs-1.0.zip" target="_self">here</a> and my demo <a href="http://bucionrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blackbird_trial.html">here</a> to try out its features. (If you use my demo, you have to save the Blackbird files in a directory named blackbirdjs that is situated in the same directory as the demo page)

Blackbird's motto says it all: say "hello" to Blackbird and "goodbye" to alert().<a href="http://bucionrails.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/blackbird_trial.html">
