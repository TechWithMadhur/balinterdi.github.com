[Octopress][octopress] is a blogging engine on top of Jekyll. It got my attention
since it provides themes and a layout that looks great on mobile
devices, too.

I had been playing with the idea to do my own simplistic theming long enough
to realize that I would never do it. The other feature I like is its plugin system:
some I'll use right away (e.g Github style codeblock) but I also like
the idea that I can write a plugin for any specific need that might
arise later.

I had had my blog on Jekyll so migration was not really hard. I hit a
few minor roadblocks on the way but [documentation][docs] is great and the author,
Brandon Mathis was really helpful on the [support forum][support] so
I could eventually sort them out.

If you like to [blog like a hacker][blog_hacker], want to own your
content and don't want to be bothered with styling, I encourage you to
join [the squid team][octopress-sites].
