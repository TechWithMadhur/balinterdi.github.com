With some delay, but I just sent an update to all of the Rock and Roll with
Ember.js customers. The book brings the app in sync with Ember, Ember Data and
Ember CLI 2.6. Among a few other improvments it:

* Makes sure the new Ember welcome page is removed before generating the
  application template: [#196](https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues/196)
* Adds a version string to the book's title and also in the Preface so that the
  reader knows whether they are reading the latest version: [#174](https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/issues/174)

The list of all accomplished things can be seen [here](https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/milestone/14?closed=1)
