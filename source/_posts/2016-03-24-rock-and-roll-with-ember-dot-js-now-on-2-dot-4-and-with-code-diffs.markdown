I have just sent an updated version of Rock and Roll with Ember.js to my
readers. [The app][1] now runs on Ember 2.4.3.

The biggest change in this release is that I now leverage code diffs in code
snippets, where this makes understanding changes easier. It looks like this in
the pdf version:

Since the last release was more than two months ago and I constantly improve
things, there is a whole slew of other changes that you can see [here][2].

guide book, sign up below to get a sample chapter:
