I have just released a new update to [the Rock and Roll Ember.js book][1],
which brings it up to Ember 2.3.0, ED 2.3.2 and Ember CLI 2.3.0-beta.1.

Other improvements made in this release are:

* Update the PageFront section as it has now become even simpler to deploy apps to PageFront
* Reset the song creation process when switching bands
* Use ember-bootstrap and remove the section on manually adding assets to the build
* Use consistent quoting in snippets and include `import Ember from 'ember'` wherever needed.
* Remove a few paragraphs that talk about how things were in the past (like `bind-attr`)

Happy reading!
