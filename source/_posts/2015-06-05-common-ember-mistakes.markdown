I wrote an article called ["The Top 8 Most Common Ember.js Developer
Mistakes"][1] for Toptal that just went live on their blog. As the name
suggests, it describes the typical pitfalls beginner, and sometimes advanced,
Ember developers make with a mitigation strategy for each of them. I am quite
happy about how it turned out and suggest you [give it a read][1].

Also, it turned out to have more than 2500 words so I thought it might be
convenient for you to have it as a pdf. It spans 13 pages and you can get it
right here below:
