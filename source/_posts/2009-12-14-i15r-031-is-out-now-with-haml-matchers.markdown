I've just released a new version of the <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/i15r">i15r gem</a> which alleviates the tedious task of internationalizing a Rails site by finding the "static" texts and replacing them with I18n message strings.

The good news -and probably the reason I am writing a blog post about it- is that it can now process <a href="http://haml-lang.com/">haml</a> files, too. This must cheer up those who -like me- have come to like haml so much they now use it for their projects. So <a href="http://gemcutter.org/gems/i15r">go get it</a> and let me know how it works for you.
