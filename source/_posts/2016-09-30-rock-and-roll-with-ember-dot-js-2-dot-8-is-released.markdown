Yesterday I published an updated version of the [Rock and Roll with Ember.js book][1].
The app now runs on 2.8 (Ember CLI, Ember and Ember Data) and, as usual, there are a few other changes.

The biggest of these was updating the Deployment chapter.
[PageFront](https://www.pagefronthq.com/) seems defunct so I replaced it with
[Surge](https://surge.sh). Above that I also updated the section on deploying
(to S3) with ember-cli-deploy as things have changed quite a bit.

You can check out the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/milestone/16?closed=1)
or the book itself [here.](http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com)

**PSA**: Ember 2.9 will bring the long-awaited new rendering engine, [Glimmer 2](http://emberjs.com/blog/2016/09/08/ember-2-8-and-2-9-beta-released.html)!

I already went ahead and updated the app to 2.9.beta to give it a whirl.

The results were pretty jaw-dropping:

I encourage you to [try switching your app to Glimmer 2](http://emberjs.com/builds/#/beta) and see if you encounter any problems.
