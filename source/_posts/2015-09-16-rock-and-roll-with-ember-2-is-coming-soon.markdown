### tl;dr

I will publish a second, extended edition of my book, Rock and Roll with Ember
in about two weeks, at the end of September. Here is what you need to know:

* I make the same promise as with the current edition: you buy it once, you get
  all updates for free until 3.0 comes out
* 4 extra chapters are added about advanced Ember topics, bringing the number
  of chapters to 18
* There will be a short launch period where the book packages are offered at a
  discount.

To be in-the-loop about the launch and know about the launch discount, sign up
below, at the end of the post. Read on for more details.

### The short past, present and future of Rock and Roll with Ember

Almost exactly 7 months ago, I published my book, Rock and Roll with Ember.js,
that helps people learn the glorious framework. Ember has since went through
quite some changes and I kept the book up-to-date with roughly an update each
month.

Ember 2 was released about a month ago, on the 13rd of August. True to the
"stability without stagnation" philosophy, the 2.0 release did not contain any
new features but dropped a lot of deadweight, API methods and syntaxes that had
been deprecated somewhere along the 1.x process.

Thanks to the transparency of the road ahead through RFCs and discussions on
other forums, it can already be clearly seen that the 2.x series will bring a
great deal of new and fascinating features. Routable components, angle-bracket
components and contextual lookup in components are some of the bigger things
that we can expect on the road to 3.0. The expected simplifications (for
example, routable components replacing controllers) will come with major changes
in how one writes an idiomatic app in Ember 2.

I've been following along the 1.x series with fascination and a keen eye to
apply the changes to my book and the included application. I want to do the same
along the Ember 2.x line and thus I hereby announce the second edition of the
book, Rock and Roll with Ember 2!

### Free updates policy

To clarify, with Rock and Roll with Ember 2,  I intend to follow the "book
development and release" process of the first edition of the book that I've now
named "Buy once, get all updates for free (until the next major version)". I
assert that if you buy any of my book packages, you get all subsequent updates
for free, until 3.0 lands (which is probably 12-18 months away. Geez, do I
really want to do that? :) ).

### New content

Keeping the book's current content up-to-date is not all. The second edition
will contain 4 extra chapters on some advanced topics (Animations, Making an
Ember CLI addon, Deployment and ES2015 & computed macros) bringing the total
chapter count to 18 (the Getting ready for Ember 2.0 is retired).

Further content changes are expected as Ember 2 evolves (see above for what can
already be known about these changes), so the content on launch day will by no
means be the final content of the book. It will constantly improve and be kept
in-sync with the latest stable 2.x version of Ember.

### When does it launch?

Very soon, probably in two weeks, mark the date (with a pencil, for the moment):
September 30, 2015.

Stand ready, Rock and Roll with Ember 2 is coming to a virtual bookstore near
you!
