I have updated the app developed in the [Rock and Roll with Ember.js book][1] to
Ember 2.2 and Ember CLI 1.13.12. I also replaced the now defunct Divshot
deployment section with another great & simple deployment option,
[PageFront][2].

Above that, there is a great deal of "bug fixes and stability improvements" in
this release, the list of which can be viewed on [Github][3].

Thank you to everybody who reported issues and helped to improve [the book][1].
