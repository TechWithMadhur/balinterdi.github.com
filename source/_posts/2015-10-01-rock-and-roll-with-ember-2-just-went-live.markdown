The 2nd edition of my critically acclaimed book, [Rock and Roll with
Ember.js][1], has just been published. The number 2 does not only denote the 2nd
edition but also the fact that it runs on Ember (and Ember Data) 2.0 and that it
will follow the 2.x development path of the framework.

The 2nd edition adds 4 new chapters: Animations, Making an Ember
addon, Writing modern JavaScript (ES2015) and Deployment. Here is the complete
set list:

1. Introduction to Ember.js
1. Ember CLI
1. Templates and data bindings
1. Routing
1. Nested routes
1. Actions
1. Components
1. Controllers
1. Advanced routing
1. Talking to a backend - with Ember Data
1. Testing
1. Sorting and searching with query params
1. Loading and error routes
1. Helpers
1. Animations
1. Making an Ember addon
1. ES2015 - Writing modern JavaScript
1. Deployment

As many readers have said, keeping the book up-to-date with the latest stable
Ember release also makes it a great reference book on current Ember idioms and
features.

Oh, and did I mention I am running a 20% discount on all packages until Monday,
10/05, 23:59 PST?  There are also a few other goodies in the bag, so I encourage
you to [check out the book now][1] before prices revert to their normal level.
