Thrifty is a simple application I have written (and am still writing) in Sinatra that tracks your expenses. You can quickly record each spending you make and assign tags to them so you can group your expenditures easily. You can then see how much you spend in different categories (by tags) possibly narrowed down to a given date interval.

Anyway, a web app is all about interaction so give it a try <a href="http://thrifty.heroku.com">on the test site</a> or download it from <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi/thrifty">its github repo</a> and run it locally. You'll also find a somewhat detailed README there.

This is a very early release so I'd appreciate any kind of feedback, be it a bug report, a comment on bad UI or anything you might find worthwhile sharing.
