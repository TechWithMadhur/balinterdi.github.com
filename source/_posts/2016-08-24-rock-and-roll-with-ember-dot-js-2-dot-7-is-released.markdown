Today marks the release of the [Rock and Roll with Ember.js book](http://rockandrollwithemberjs.com),
version 2.7, which means the app built in the book now runs on Ember 2.7 (and uses Ember CLI 2.7).

There is a number of other small fixes, the full list of which you can see
[here](https://github.com/balinterdi/rarwe-issues/milestone/15?closed=1).
