<h2>Credo</h2>

<p>I am Bálint Érdi, a web developer living in Budapest, Hungary. I've been working as an independent consultant/freelancer since 2008. In my work I recommend my clients to get to a working application quickly that comprises the essential features and then add further ones gradually. As a developer I strive to produce clean, simple and working code. Yes, you guessed it right, I am an advocate of agile techniques and consequently I like to involve the client in the development process and make it all transparent to him.</p>

<p>If you happen to be a developer you have probably found out that I use TDD (Test Driven Development) as a development methodology. In it I feel I have found not just a way to be more confident in the quality of the code I churn out but also a tool to increase both my productivity and client satisfaction. (It also feels better, you should really try it.) I consider <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> an excellent tool to suit these needs.</p>

<p>I constantly improve my existing skills and add new ones to my arsenal. I do not cease to look for further improving my ways to build stable and top quality applications and achieve a sustainable and productive daily schedule. I tend to believe in the "be a specialist, be a generalist" motto (that I first saw in Chad Fowler's <a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/cfcar2/the-passionate-programmer" title="The Passinate Programmer">excellent book</a>) and consequently I set aside time to enhance my abilities as a designer, a manager, a sysadmin, a salesman, etc.</p>

<p>I love <a href="http://github.com/balinterdi">open source</a>. I find that contributing to OS projects is an excellent way to reciprocate to the community, to learn from the best and to make yourself -more- known.</p>

<p>With two fellow Ruby enthusiasts, I organize the local Ruby user group, <a href="http//meetup.com/budapest-rb">budapest.rb</a></p>.
