I realized this would be a key feature of any blog that aims to include code snippets in posts right after my friend, Bronson, told me so. With Wordpress, it seems, the problem is not that there are no tools for a certain task but that there are too many. Anyway, I finally found <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-syntax/">this one</a> to perfectly suit my needs. It supports a plethora of programming/markup languages and the only thing you should add to your code blocks, is a lang attribute to the &lt;pre&gt; like so:

<pre lang="html4strict">
   <pre lang="ruby">
    (ruby code comes here)
   </pre >
</pre>

My code  in <a href="http://bucionrails.com/2008/04/09/quick-adaptor-my-role-model/">my earlier post</a> looks a lot better, doesn't it?
