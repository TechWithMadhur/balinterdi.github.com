I have just returned from Madrid where the Spanish Rails Conference, <a href="http://www.conferenciarails.org/">Conferencia Rails</a> was held. I liked it quite a lot, there were several interesting talks most of which made me want to learn all of that and very fast (one thing conferences do to me is to boost that healthy feeling of wanting to always learn and discover new things). So I would like to add my e-voice to the web noise: congratulations and thank you to the organizers and presenters!
