David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Rails is doing an <a href="http://loudthinking.com/posts/29-the-rails-myths">outstanding series of blog posts</a> on <a href="http://loudthinking.com/">his blog</a> to derail (pun intended) some common myths that claim Rails does not do this or that and that hinders (or rather, slows down) its widespread acceptance.

I am sure David holds his best for last and will refute the infamous "Rails does not scale" in the final episode of the series.
