That was too long to twitter, so here it goes.

If you use Mail (OS-X) when replying to a message you can select some text in the email you want to reply to and then hit reply. The new email will only include the text you selected so you don't have to delete all the lines you don't need. I hope someone finds this useful, I really do.
