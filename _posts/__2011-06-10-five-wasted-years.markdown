title: Five wasted years - on the futility of university education
layout: post
---

I graduated from the Technical University of Budapest to earn a M.Sc. in
Software Engineering. It is supposed to be an asset on your CV although
I've recently come to the conclusion that the years of university
formation is not worth it.

When trying to summarize what advantage university education
brought me there is precious little I can think of. 5 years is a lot of
time to spend without actually getting something out of it for one's
professional career.

Obviously I've formed my opinion based on my university experience which
might not (and probably *is* not) be applicable to all higher education.
Philosophy, economics and medicine all require different formation. Also,
there is a great variance between countries although even the famously high-standard
US education seems to yield not practical but rather looks-good-on-my-CV benefits. [1]

## Learn to learn?

Tech is changing extremely rapidly. Today's hotness could be a thing of
the past in a few years. Consequently universities should not try to keep up with the
pace and teach students state-of-the-art stuff. Higher education needs to transcend
short-term utility and provide a base one can build on for the rest of
his career and life.

What is probably considered the essence of higher education is "learn to
learn". It is the idea that universities need to teach future-engineers
how to quickly adapt to new fields and techniques (programming
languages, databases, architectures, etc.).

This is appealing but universities don't do that. I had to sit through
long hours of material not even vaguely related to software engineering.
The practical stuff (e.g programming languages) was taught in stone age style (programming on paper).
The other subjects, those that were supposed to provide us the broad vision, I suppose, were way too
much in volume and failed to achieve that goal.

Two things come to mind that yield are somewhat useful in my everyday tasks.

One is the math, especially algorithm theory. When faced with a programming challenge I
can recall on some occasions an algorithm used to resolve a similar
problem.

The other is the actual programming itself. Unlike other students, I had
not really had a programming history when I started college, so writing
code (even if it was terrible and on paper) helped me get into the
process of solving problems. And that's what it should be all about.

# Make to learn

In my current job I'm lucky to work with some guys who have never
finished college but instead started to work earlier. They might not
know about [Prim's algorithm][3] or the [intermediate value theorem][4],
but I think the result of the time they spent making things surpass the time I
spent learning the above.
